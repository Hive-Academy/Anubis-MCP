# MCP Workflow Manager

A comprehensive **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for AI workflow automation and task management. Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [`@rekog/mcp-nest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rekog/mcp-nest) for production-ready reliability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Role-Based Workflow**: Structured AI coordination (Boomerang, Researcher, Architect, Developer, Code Review)
- **üìä Task Management**: Complete task lifecycle with status tracking and delegation
- **üéØ Implementation Planning**: Batch-based subtask organization and execution
- **üìà Analytics & Reporting**: Comprehensive workflow analytics and progress monitoring
- **üîí Project Isolation**: Automatic database separation for multi-project workflows
- **üöÄ Zero Setup**: Just add to MCP config - no manual installation required
- **üì¶ Self-Contained NPX Package**: Automatic dependency management with no external requirements
- **üîß Environment-Aware**: Adapts behavior for NPX, global, and local installations

## üöÄ Quick Setup

**No installation needed** - just add the configuration to your MCP client and everything works automatically!

### NPX Setup (Recommended - Automatic Project Isolation)

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

Add to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code

Add to your settings or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "workflow-manager": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Self-Contained Package Benefits:**

- **üîß Automatic Dependency Management**: Prisma client generation and database migrations
- **üé≠ Conditional Playwright Setup**: Browser installation only when report generation needed
- **üåç Environment Detection**: Adapts for NPX vs global vs local installations
- **üõ°Ô∏è Graceful Degradation**: Disables optional features if dependencies unavailable
- **üöÄ Works on Clean Systems**: No local dependencies required beyond Node.js
- **üìä Automatic Project Isolation**: Each project gets its own database automatically

**What happens automatically on first run:**

1. **Environment Detection**: Identifies NPX vs global vs local installation
2. **Prisma Client Generation**: Generates database client automatically
3. **Database Setup**: Creates and migrates database schema
4. **Playwright Browsers**: Installs browsers conditionally for report generation
5. **Project Isolation**: Creates project-specific database based on directory

### NPX Environment Variables (Optional)

For enhanced control over NPX package behavior, you can set environment variables:

#### Cursor IDE with Environment Variables

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "D:/projects/your-project",
        "DISABLE_REPORT_GENERATION": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop with Environment Variables

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/Users/username/projects/your-project",
        "DISABLE_REPORT_GENERATION": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Available Environment Variables:**

- **`PROJECT_ROOT`**: Explicit project root directory (defaults to current working directory)

  - **Purpose**: Ensures reports and database are created in the correct project location
  - **When to use**: When the current working directory doesn't match your project root
  - **Example**: `"PROJECT_ROOT": "D:/projects/my-app"`

- **`DISABLE_REPORT_GENERATION`**: Disable Playwright browser installation and report generation
  - **Purpose**: Faster startup when reports aren't needed
  - **Values**: `"true"` or `"false"` (default: `"false"`)
  - **Example**: `"DISABLE_REPORT_GENERATION": "true"`

**‚úÖ Benefits of Setting PROJECT_ROOT:**

- **üìä Correct Report Location**: Reports generated in your project directory
- **üóÑÔ∏è Proper Database Location**: Database created in project-specific location
- **üîí Project Isolation**: Prevents data mixing between different projects
- **üéØ Predictable Paths**: Always know where your workflow data is stored

### Docker Setup (Production/Teams)

**No manual setup required!** Docker automatically creates directories and initializes the database.

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/prisma/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/prisma/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ What happens automatically:**

- Database creation and initialization
- Directory structure setup
- Schema migrations
- Permissions configuration

## üîí Project Isolation

### NPX (Automatic)

Each project automatically gets its own database:

```
/project-a/workflow.db  ‚Üê Project A's data
/project-b/workflow.db  ‚Üê Project B's data
```

### Docker (Automatic Directory Creation)

**No manual directory creation needed!** Use project-specific volume names:

```json
// Project A
"args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "project-a-workflow:/app/prisma/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]

// Project B
"args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "project-b-workflow:/app/prisma/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
```

**Why `/app/prisma/data`?** Prisma resolves the `DATABASE_URL="file:./data/workflow.db"` relative to the schema location (`/app/prisma/schema.prisma`), resulting in `/app/prisma/data/workflow.db`. Docker automatically creates this path and ensures proper database persistence.

## üìä Local Report Access

**Want to access generated reports directly on your file system?** Use host directory mounting:

### Setup (Automatic Directory Creation)

**No manual directory creation needed!** Docker creates all directories automatically.

#### Cursor IDE (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/your-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/your-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windows Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### macOS/Linux Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
