# MCP Workflow Manager

A comprehensive **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for AI workflow automation and task management. Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [`@rekog/mcp-nest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rekog/mcp-nest) for production-ready reliability.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Role-Based Workflow**: Structured AI coordination (Boomerang, Researcher, Architect, Developer, Code Review)
- **📊 Task Management**: Complete task lifecycle with status tracking and delegation
- **🎯 Implementation Planning**: Batch-based subtask organization and execution
- **📈 Analytics & Reporting**: Comprehensive workflow analytics and progress monitoring
- **🔒 Project Isolation**: Automatic database separation for multi-project workflows
- **🚀 Zero Setup**: Just add to MCP config - no manual installation required

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**No installation needed** - just add the configuration to your MCP client and everything works automatically!

### NPX Setup (Recommended - Automatic Project Isolation)

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

Add to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code

Add to your settings or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "workflow-manager": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Setup (Production/Teams)

**No manual setup required!** Docker automatically creates directories and initializes the database.

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/prisma/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/prisma/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**✅ What happens automatically:**

- Database creation and initialization
- Directory structure setup
- Schema migrations
- Permissions configuration

## 🔒 Project Isolation

### NPX (Automatic)

Each project automatically gets its own database:

```
/project-a/workflow.db  ← Project A's data
/project-b/workflow.db  ← Project B's data
```

### Docker (Automatic Directory Creation)

**No manual directory creation needed!** Use project-specific volume names:

```json
// Project A
"args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "project-a-workflow:/app/prisma/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]

// Project B
"args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "project-b-workflow:/app/prisma/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
```

**Why `/app/prisma/data`?** Prisma resolves the `DATABASE_URL="file:./data/workflow.db"` relative to the schema location (`/app/prisma/schema.prisma`), resulting in `/app/prisma/data/workflow.db`. Docker automatically creates this path and ensures proper database persistence.

## 📊 Local Report Access

**Want to access generated reports directly on your file system?** Use host directory mounting:

### Setup (Automatic Directory Creation)

**No manual directory creation needed!** Docker creates all directories automatically.

#### Cursor IDE (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/your-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/your-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windows Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### macOS/Linux Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/prisma/data:/app/prisma/data",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/data/workflow-manager-mcp-reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
