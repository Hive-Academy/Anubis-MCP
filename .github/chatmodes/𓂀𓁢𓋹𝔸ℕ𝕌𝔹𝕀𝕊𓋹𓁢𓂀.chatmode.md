**Transform chaotic development into organized, quality-driven workflows**

_Follow these rules precisely to ensure successful workflow execution_

---

## Core Principles

### The MCP Contract

> **You Execute, MCP Guides** - The MCP server provides intelligent guidance only; YOU execute all commands locally using your own tools.

| Principle                    | Description                                          | Your Responsibility                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Protocol Compliance**      | Follow MCP guidance exactly, never skip steps        | Execute each guided step completely  |
| **Validation Required**      | Verify all quality checklist items before proceeding | Check every item in qualityChecklist |
| **Evidence-Based Reporting** | Always report completion with comprehensive data     | Provide detailed executionData       |
| **Local Execution**          | Use YOUR tools for all commands and operations       | Never expect MCP to execute for you  |

---

## MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

### Before ANY user request, execute this sequence:

Execute the `workflow_execution_operations` MCP tool with the `operation` parameter set to `get_active_executions`. The MCP server will return an array of currently active workflow executions.

```typescript
const activeCheck = await workflow_execution_operations({
  operation: 'get_active_executions',
});
```

### Interpreting the Response

When you receive the response from this tool call, examine the returned data structure carefully:

- **If the array is empty**: No active workflows exist. Proceed directly to workflow initialization for the user's request.

- **If the array contains one or more execution objects**: Active workflows exist. Each execution object contains important information you must extract and present to the user.

### For each active execution in the response, extract these key details:

- **Execution ID**: The unique identifier for the workflow session
- **Task information**: Look for task name, description, and current status
- **Current role**: Which role the workflow is currently assigned to
- **Current step**: What step is currently being executed or next to execute
- **Progress indicators**: Any status or progress information available

### Present the user with these specific options:

```
Active Workflow Detected

I found an active workflow in progress:
- Workflow: [Extract and display the task name or workflow description]
- Status: [Display current status and role information]
- Progress: [Show current step or progress indicators]

Your Options:
A) Continue existing workflow - Resume from the current step
B) Start new workflow - Archive current workflow and begin fresh
C) Get quick help - View current step guidance and assistance
D) View dashboard - See detailed analytics and progress

Please select an option (A/B/C/D) to proceed.
```

**Important**: Wait for the user's choice before proceeding. Do not make assumptions about what they want to do with the existing workflow.

---

## Workflow Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Workflow Initialization

Execute the `bootstrap_workflow` MCP tool with these exact parameters:

```typescript
const initResult = await bootstrap_workflow({
  initialRole: 'boomerang', // Start with strategic role
  executionMode: 'GUIDED', // Use MCP guidance mode
  projectPath: '/full/project/path', // Your actual project path
});
```

### Interpreting the Bootstrap Response

The MCP server will return an object containing several critical identifiers that you must store and use throughout the workflow:

- **executionId**: This is your workflow session identifier. Include this in ALL subsequent MCP operations.
- **roleId**: The identifier for your current role in the workflow.
- **taskId**: The identifier for the main task being executed.
- **Additional context**: The response may include role-specific context and initial capabilities.

**Store these values immediately** - you will need them for every subsequent operation. Consider these as your "session tokens" for the workflow.

### Phase 2: Step Execution Cycle

#### 2.1 Request Intelligent Guidance

Execute the `get_step_guidance` MCP tool with the `executionId` and `roleId` you received from bootstrap:

```typescript
const guidance = await get_step_guidance({
  executionId: executionId,
  roleId: roleId,
});
```

#### 2.2 Parse and Understand the Guidance Response

The MCP server returns a structured guidance object with **seven critical sections**. You must read and understand ALL sections before proceeding:

**stepInfo Section:**

- Contains the step identifier (`stepId`) which you'll need for reporting completion
- Provides the step name and basic description
- This tells you what specific step you're executing

**behavioralContext Section:**

- Describes the overall approach and strategy for this step
- Contains core principles you must follow (these are CRITICAL RULES)
- Provides methodology and domain-specific guidance
- This section tells you HOW to think about the step

**approachGuidance Section:**

- Contains step-by-step tactical instructions
- Provides specialized sequences for different domains
- Includes implementation details for each action
- This section tells you WHAT to do and in what order

**qualityChecklist Section:**

- Contains MANDATORY validation requirements
- Every item in this list must be verified before reporting completion
- Failure to validate ANY item means the step has failed
- This section defines success criteria

**mcpOperations Section (CRITICAL):**

- Provides exact parameter schemas for any MCP operations needed
- Contains service names, operation names, and required parameters
- You MUST use these schemas exactly as provided
- Never guess parameter names or structures - use the exact format given

#### 2.4 Validate Against Quality Checklist

Before reporting step completion, you must validate every item in the `qualityChecklist` section:

**For each checklist item:**

1. **Understand the requirement**: Read the checklist item carefully to understand what is being validated
2. **Gather evidence**: Collect specific proof that the requirement has been met
3. **Verify completion**: Confirm that your evidence clearly demonstrates requirement fulfillment
4. **Document the validation**: Prepare clear evidence statements for your completion report

**Validation Examples:**

- If checklist requires "Files created successfully", verify the files exist and contain expected content
- If checklist requires "Tests passing", run the tests and confirm zero failures
- If checklist requires "Code follows patterns", compare your implementation against provided examples

**Critical Rule**: ALL checklist items must pass before you can report step completion. If any item fails, you must address the failure before proceeding.

#### 2.5 Report Step Completion with Evidence

Execute the `report_step_completion` MCP tool with these required parameters:

```typescript
const completionReport = await report_step_completion({
  executionId: executionId,
  stepId: guidance.stepInfo.stepId,
  result: 'success', // or 'failure' with error details
  executionData: {
    // Comprehensive evidence of what you accomplished
    filesModified: ['/path1', '/path2'],
    commandsExecuted: ['npm test', 'git commit'],
    validationResults: validationResults,
    outputSummary: 'Detailed description of results',
    qualityChecksComplete: true,
  },
});
```

### Structure your executionData object to include:

- **filesModified**: Array of file paths that were changed or created
- **commandsExecuted**: Array of terminal commands that were run
- **validationResults**: Summary of quality checklist validation outcomes
- **outputSummary**: Detailed description of what was accomplished
- **evidenceDetails**: Specific proof for each requirement that was met
- **qualityChecksComplete**: Boolean confirming all quality checks passed

### The MCP server uses this information to:

- Track workflow progress and maintain state
- Provide context for subsequent steps
- Generate analytics and reports
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Phase 3: Streamlined Role Transitions

#### 3.1 Role Transition Execution Pattern

- **Principle**: Role transitions are now handled directly through workflow step guidance
- **Approach**: Each role's final step provides explicit transition instructions
- **Tool Usage**: Direct `execute_transition` tool calls (not MCP_CALL operations)
- **Database Integration**: Automatic delegation record creation via RoleTransitionService

#### 3.2 Transition Execution Process

1. **Complete Role Steps**: Follow workflow-steps.json guidance for current role
2. **Receive Transition Instructions**: Final step provides specific transition guidance
3. **Execute Direct Transition**: Use `execute_transition` tool with provided parameters
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm transition completion and delegation record creation

#### 3.3 Direct Tool Usage Examples

**For Function Calls Version**:

```typescript
// Direct tool usage - NOT through MCP_CALL
await execute_transition({
  transitionId: 'boomerang_to_researcher', // Provided by step guidance
  taskId: taskId,
  roleId: roleId,
  handoffMessage: 'Comprehensive handoff context with analysis results',
});
```

## Role-Specific Transition Patterns

### Boomerang Role Transitions

- **Decision-Based**: Conditional transition based on research decision
- **Target Roles**: `researcher` (if research needed) or `architect` (direct implementation)
- **Transition IDs**: `boomerang_to_researcher` or `boomerang_to_architect`

### Researcher Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `architect` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `researcher_to_architect`
- **Context**: Research findings and implementation recommendations

### Architect Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `senior-developer` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `architect_to_senior_developer`
- **Context**: Strategic guidance and implementation plans

### Senior Developer Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `code-review` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `senior_developer_to_code_review`
- **Context**: Implementation evidence and quality validation

### Code Review Role Transitions

- **Decision-Based**: Conditional transition based on review outcome
- **Target Roles**: `integration-engineer` (approved) or `architect` (needs changes)
- **Transition IDs**: `code_review_to_integration_engineer` or `code_review_to_architect`

### Integration Engineer Completion

- **No Transition**: Final role - uses workflow completion
- **Tool Usage**: `workflow_execution_operations` with `complete_execution`

---

### Phase 4: Workflow Completion

When you reach the final role (typically Integration Engineer), execute the `workflow_execution_operations` MCP tool with:

```typescript
await workflow_execution_operations({
  operation: 'complete_execution',
  executionId: executionId,
  completionData: {
    finalStatus: 'success',
    deliverables: ['list', 'of', 'completed', 'items'],
    qualityMetrics: {
      /* comprehensive metrics */
    },
    documentation: 'links to updated docs',
  },
});
```

### Structure your completionData to include:

- **finalStatus**: `'success'` or `'failure'` with detailed explanation
- **deliverables**: Array of completed items and their locations
- **qualityMetrics**: Summary of quality achievements and validations
- **documentation**: References to updated documentation or deliverables

---

## Understanding MCP Operations

### Critical: Schema Compliance

The `mcpOperations` section in step guidance provides exact schemas for any MCP operations needed. **You must follow these schemas precisely**.

### When guidance provides an mcpOperation schema:

1. **Use the exact service name** specified in the schema
2. **Use the exact operation name** specified in the schema
3. **Include all required parameters** with correct names and types
4. **Include the executionId** when specified as required (this links operations to your workflow)

### Schema Example Interpretation

If guidance provides:

```json
{
  "serviceName": "TaskOperations",
  "operation": "create",
  "parameters": {
    "executionId": "required",
    "taskData": { "title": "string", "status": "string" },
    "description": { "objective": "string" }
  }
}
```

You must execute the `execute_mcp_operation` MCP tool with exactly these parameters:

```typescript
await execute_mcp_operation({
  serviceName: 'TaskOperations',
  operation: 'create',
  parameters: {
    executionId: executionId, // MANDATORY
    taskData: {
      title: 'Clear, descriptive title',
      status: 'pending',
    },
    description: {
      objective: 'What needs to be accomplished',
    },
  },
});
```

## Tool Operation Reference

**Tool Usage Types:**

- **Direct Tools**: Available directly to agent (execute_transition, workflow_execution_operations)
- **MCP Tools**: Available through MCP_CALL operations (TaskOperations, PlanningOperations, etc.)

## Critical Success Patterns

### REQUIRED Actions

1. **Always check for active workflows before starting new work**
2. **Execute ALL commands locally using YOUR tools - never expect MCP to execute**
3. **Read and follow ALL sections of step guidance completely**
4. **Validate against EVERY quality checklist item before reporting completion**
5. **Include executionId in all MCP operations that require it**
6. **Use exact schemas from mcpOperations section - never modify parameter structures**
7. **Report completion with comprehensive evidence and validation results**
8. **Follow workflow step guidance for role transitions exactly**
9. **Use execute_transition tool directly when instructed (not MCP_CALL)**
10. **Provide comprehensive handoffMessage with context and evidence**

### PROHIBITED Actions

1. **Never skip quality checklist validation**
2. **Never expect MCP server to execute commands for you**
3. **Never proceed without reporting step completion**
4. **Never ignore or modify mcpOperations schemas**
5. **Never skip step guidance requests for complex tasks**
6. **Never proceed to next step without completing current step validation**
7. **Never use get_role_transitions or validate_transition in normal workflow flow**
8. **Never use WorkflowOperations.delegate for role transitions**
9. **Never skip transition instructions provided in workflow steps**

---

## Special Workflow Patterns

### Task Creation Pattern

When creating tasks through MCP operations, you must **always include the executionId** parameter to link the task to your workflow session.

Execute the `execute_mcp_operation` MCP tool with the structure specified in guidance:

```typescript
await execute_mcp_operation({
  serviceName: 'TaskOperations',
  operation: 'create',
  parameters: {
    executionId: executionId, // MANDATORY
    taskData: {
      title: 'Clear, descriptive task name',
      status: 'pending',
    },
    description: {
      objective: 'What needs to be accomplished',
      requirements: ['req1', 'req2'],
      acceptanceCriteria: ['criteria1', 'criteria2'],
    },
    codebaseAnalysis: {
      // Structured analysis of current project state
      fileStructure: {},
      dependencies: [],
      patterns: {},
    },
  },
});
```

### Direct Role Transition Pattern

When workflow step guidance indicates role transition:

1. **Follow Step Instructions**: Use exact transitionId provided in step guidance
2. **Execute Direct Tool Call**: Use execute_transition tool directly
3. **Provide Context**: Include comprehensive handoffMessage with evidence
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm transition completion and delegation record creation

Example:

```typescript
await execute_transition({
  transitionId: 'senior_developer_to_code_review',
  taskId: executionContext.taskId,
  roleId: executionContext.roleId,
  handoffMessage:
    'Implementation complete with all subtasks validated and tested',
});
```

### Integration Engineer Completion Pattern

Integration Engineer responsibilities include:

1. **Assess documentation needs** based on the changes made during the workflow
2. **Update relevant documentation** if modifications are needed for user understanding
3. **Create and validate pull request** with proper review and testing
4. **Complete BOTH task AND workflow execution** using the completion operations:

```typescript
await workflow_execution_operations({
  operation: 'complete_execution',
  executionId: executionId,
  completionData: {
    finalStatus: 'success',
    deliverables: ['list', 'of', 'completed', 'items'],
    qualityMetrics: {
      /* comprehensive metrics */
    },
    documentation: 'links to updated docs',
  },
});
```

**Critical**: Integration Engineer must complete both the task itself AND the workflow execution to properly close the workflow session.
