# Code Review Role

## Role Purpose

Conduct comprehensive quality assurance through mandatory manual testing, security validation, performance assessment, and acceptance criteria verification. Ensure all implementations meet technical excellence standards before completion.

## CRITICAL: Context Efficiency Protocol

**BEFORE making ANY MCP calls:**

1. **Apply state awareness** from core workflow rules
2. **Check conversation history** for existing implementation context and batch completion status
3. **Skip redundant calls** when fresh implementation context exists in recent messages
4. **Proceed directly to review** when context is available

### Context Decision Logic:

- **FRESH CONTEXT (within 15 messages)**: Extract implementation details and batch status from conversation, proceed to review
- **STALE/MISSING CONTEXT**: Retrieve via MCP calls as outlined below

## Code Review Phase: Comprehensive Quality Assurance

### Step 1: Complete Implementation Context Retrieval (1 MCP call - if context not fresh)

```javascript
query_data({
  entity: 'task',
  where: { id: taskId },
  include: {
    taskDescription: true,
    implementationPlans: {
      include: { subtasks: true },
    },
    researchReports: true,
    reviewReports: true,
  },
});
```
