# 🏺 Anubis - Divine Guidance for AI Workflows: Universal AI Agent Protocol

**Anubis is the divine guide for AI workflows - the first MCP-compliant system that embeds intelligent guidance directly into each step, ensuring your AI agents follow complex development processes consistently and reliably.**

**Transform chaotic development into organized, quality-driven workflows**

_Follow these rules precisely to ensure successful workflow execution_

---

## Core Principles

### The MCP Contract

> **You Execute, MCP Guides** - The MCP server provides intelligent guidance only; YOU execute all commands locally using your own tools.

| Principle                    | Description                                          | Your Responsibility                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Protocol Compliance**      | Follow MCP guidance exactly, never skip steps        | Execute each guided step completely  |
| **Validation Required**      | Verify all quality checklist items before proceeding | Check every item in qualityChecklist |
| **Evidence-Based Reporting** | Always report completion with comprehensive data     | Provide detailed executionData       |
| **Local Execution**          | Use YOUR tools for all commands and operations       | Never expect MCP to execute for you  |

---

## MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

### Before ANY user request, execute this sequence:

Execute the workflow execution operations MCP tool using the XML format shown below. The MCP server will return an array of currently active workflow executions.

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>workflow_execution_operations</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "operation": "get_active_executions"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Interpreting the Response

When you receive the response from this XML operation, examine the returned data structure carefully:

- **If the response indicates no active executions**: The returned array will be empty or the response will indicate zero active workflows. Proceed directly to workflow initialization for the user's request.

- **If the response contains active execution data**: The response will include one or more execution objects with workflow information that you must extract and present to the user.

### For each active execution in the response, extract these key details:

- **Execution identifier**: Look for the unique ID that identifies this workflow session
- **Task information**: Extract task name, description, and current status from the execution data
- **Current role assignment**: Identify which role the workflow is currently assigned to
- **Current step information**: Determine what step is currently being executed or is next
- **Progress indicators**: Extract any status or progress information available in the response

### Present the user with these specific options:

```
Active Workflow Detected

I found an active workflow in progress:
- Workflow: [Extract and display the task name or workflow description from response]
- Status: [Display current status and role information from response data]
- Progress: [Show current step or progress indicators from response]

Your Options:
A) Continue existing workflow - Resume from the current step
B) Start new workflow - Archive current workflow and begin fresh
C) Get quick help - View current step guidance and assistance
D) View dashboard - See detailed analytics and progress

Please select an option (A/B/C/D) to proceed.
```

**Important**: Wait for the user's choice before proceeding. Do not make assumptions about what they want to do with the existing workflow.

---

## Workflow Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Workflow Initialization

Execute the bootstrap workflow MCP tool using the XML format with these exact parameter values:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>bootstrap_workflow</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "initialRole": "boomerang",
  "executionMode": "GUIDED",
  "projectPath": "/full/project/path"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

Replace `/full/project/path` with the actual full path to the project directory you're working in.

### Interpreting the Bootstrap Response

The MCP server will return response data containing several critical identifiers that you must extract and store for use throughout the workflow:

- **executionId**: Extract this workflow session identifier from the response. You must include this in ALL subsequent MCP operations.
- **roleId**: Extract the identifier for your current role in the workflow from the response.
- **taskId**: Extract the identifier for the main task being executed from the response.
- **Additional context**: The response may include role-specific context and initial capabilities that you should note.

**Store these values immediately** - you will need them for every subsequent XML operation. Consider these as your "session tokens" for the workflow.

### Phase 2: Step Execution Cycle

#### 2.1 Request Intelligent Guidance

Execute the step guidance MCP tool using the executionId and roleId you extracted from the bootstrap response:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>get_step_guidance</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "executionId": "your-execution-id-from-bootstrap",
  "roleId": "your-role-id-from-bootstrap"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

#### 2.2 Parse and Understand the Guidance Response

The MCP server returns a structured guidance response containing **seven critical sections**. You must read and understand ALL sections before proceeding:

**stepInfo Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for the stepInfo data which contains:

- **stepId**: Extract this identifier - you'll need it for reporting completion
- **step name**: Extract the name and basic description
- This section tells you what specific step you're executing

**behavioralContext Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for behavioralContext data which contains:

- **approach**: Extract the overall strategy for this step
- **principles**: Extract core principles you must follow (these are CRITICAL RULES)
- **methodology**: Extract domain-specific guidance
- This section tells you HOW to think about the step

**approachGuidance Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for approachGuidance data which contains:

- **stepByStep instructions**: Extract the tactical sequence of actions
- **specialized sequences**: Extract domain-specific implementation details
- **action details**: Extract specifics for each operation
- This section tells you WHAT to do and in what order

**localExecution Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for localExecution data which contains:

- **command descriptions**: Extract information about operations YOU must execute using YOUR tools
- **purpose explanations**: Extract context for why these operations are needed
- **tool specifications**: Extract guidance on which of your tools to use
- This section clarifies that YOU do the work, not the MCP server

**qualityChecklist Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for qualityChecklist data which contains:

- **validation requirements**: Extract each mandatory requirement
- **success criteria**: Extract the criteria that must be met
- **evidence requirements**: Extract what proof is needed
- Every item in this list must be verified before reporting completion
- This section defines success criteria

**mcpOperations Section Analysis (CRITICAL):**

Examine the response for mcpOperations data which contains:

- **service names**: Extract exact service names to use
- **operation names**: Extract exact operation names to call
- **parameter schemas**: Extract required parameters with correct names and types
- You MUST use these schemas exactly as provided in your XML operations
- Never guess parameter names or structures - use the exact format given

**successCriteria Section Analysis:**

Examine the response for successCriteria data which contains:

- **completion requirements**: Extract clear definition of step completion
- **measurable outcomes**: Extract specific results to verify
- **quality standards**: Extract standards that must be met

#### 2.3 Execute All Required Actions Locally

Based on the guidance response data, use YOUR tools to execute all required operations:

**For file operations**, use your file management tools in XML format:

```xml
<read_file>
  <path>/path/to/file</path>
</read_file>

<edit_file>
  <path>/path/to/file</path>
  <content>new content</content>
</edit_file>

<create_directory>
  <path>/new/directory</path>
</create_directory>
```

**For terminal commands**, use your command execution tools in XML format:

```xml
<run_terminal_cmd>
  <command>npm install</command>
</run_terminal_cmd>

<run_terminal_cmd>
  <command>git add .</command>
</run_terminal_cmd>

<run_terminal_cmd>
  <command>git commit -m "descriptive message"</command>
</run_terminal_cmd>
```

**For project analysis**, use your codebase tools in XML format:

```xml
<codebase_search>
  <query>function name</query>
</codebase_search>
```

**Critical**: The MCP server provides guidance only. YOU must execute every command and operation using your own tools and XML syntax.

#### 2.4 Validate Against Quality Checklist

Before reporting step completion, you must validate every item from the qualityChecklist section of the guidance response:

**For each checklist item you extracted:**

1. **Understand the requirement**: Read the checklist item carefully to understand what is being validated
2. **Gather evidence**: Collect specific proof that the requirement has been met using your tools
3. **Verify completion**: Confirm that your evidence clearly demonstrates requirement fulfillment
4. **Document the validation**: Prepare clear evidence statements for your completion report

**Validation Examples:**

- If checklist requires "Files created successfully", use your file tools to verify the files exist and contain expected content
- If checklist requires "Tests passing", run the tests using your terminal tools and confirm zero failures
- If checklist requires "Code follows patterns", compare your implementation against examples provided in guidance

**Critical Rule**: ALL checklist items must pass before you can report step completion. If any item fails, you must address the failure before proceeding.

#### 2.5 Report Step Completion with Evidence

Execute the completion reporting MCP tool using this XML format:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>report_step_completion</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "executionId": "your-execution-id",
  "stepId": "step-id-from-guidance-response",
  "result": "success",
  "executionData": {
    "filesModified": ["/path1", "/path2"],
    "commandsExecuted": ["npm test", "git commit"],
    "validationResults": "All quality checks passed with evidence",
    "outputSummary": "Detailed description of accomplished work",
    "evidenceDetails": "Specific proof for each requirement met",
    "qualityChecksComplete": true
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Structure your executionData to include:

- **filesModified**: Array of file paths that were changed or created
- **commandsExecuted**: Array of terminal commands that were run
- **validationResults**: Summary of quality checklist validation outcomes
- **outputSummary**: Detailed description of what was accomplished
- **evidenceDetails**: Specific proof for each requirement that was met
- **qualityChecksComplete**: Boolean confirming all quality checks passed

### The MCP server uses this information to:

- Track workflow progress and maintain state
- Provide context for subsequent steps
- Generate analytics and reports
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Phase 3: Streamlined Role Transitions

#### 3.1 Role Transition Execution Pattern

- **Principle**: Role transitions are now handled directly through workflow step guidance
- **Approach**: Each role's final step provides explicit transition instructions
- **Tool Usage**: Direct `execute_transition` tool calls (not MCP_CALL operations)
- **Database Integration**: Automatic delegation record creation via RoleTransitionService

#### 3.2 Transition Execution Process

1. **Complete Role Steps**: Follow workflow-steps.json guidance for current role
2. **Receive Transition Instructions**: Final step provides specific transition guidance
3. **Execute Direct Transition**: Use `execute_transition` tool with provided parameters
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm transition completion and delegation record creation

#### 3.3 Direct Tool Usage Examples

**For XML Version**:

```xml
<!-- Direct tool usage - NOT through MCP operations -->
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_transition</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "transitionId": "selected-transition-id",
  "taskId": "your-task-id",
  "roleId": "your-role-id"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

## Role-Specific Transition Patterns

### Boomerang Role Transitions

- **Decision-Based**: Conditional transition based on research decision
- **Target Roles**: `researcher` (if research needed) or `architect` (direct implementation)
- **Transition IDs**: `boomerang_to_researcher` or `boomerang_to_architect`

### Researcher Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `architect` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `researcher_to_architect`
- **Context**: Research findings and implementation recommendations

### Architect Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `senior-developer` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `architect_to_senior_developer`
- **Context**: Strategic guidance and implementation plans

### Senior Developer Role Transitions

- **Target Role**: `code-review` (always)
- **Transition ID**: `senior_developer_to_code_review`
- **Context**: Implementation evidence and quality validation

### Code Review Role Transitions

- **Decision-Based**: Conditional transition based on review outcome
- **Target Roles**: `integration-engineer` (approved) or `architect` (needs changes)
- **Transition IDs**: `code_review_to_integration_engineer` or `code_review_to_architect`

### Integration Engineer Completion

- **No Transition**: Final role - uses workflow completion
- **Tool Usage**: `workflow_execution_operations` with `complete_execution`

---

### Phase 4: Workflow Completion

When you reach the final role (typically Integration Engineer), execute this completion MCP tool:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>workflow_execution_operations</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "operation": "complete_execution",
  "executionId": "your-execution-id",
  "completionData": {
    "finalStatus": "success",
    "deliverables": ["list", "of", "completed", "items"],
    "qualityMetrics": "comprehensive metrics summary",
    "documentation": "links to updated docs"
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Structure your completionData to include:

- **finalStatus**: `success` or `failure` with detailed explanation
- **deliverables**: Array of completed items and their locations
- **qualityMetrics**: Summary of quality achievements and validations
- **documentation**: References to updated documentation or deliverables

---

## Understanding MCP Operations

### Critical: Schema Compliance in XML

The `mcpOperations` section in step guidance provides exact schemas for any MCP operations needed. **You must follow these schemas precisely in your XML syntax**.

### When guidance provides an mcpOperation schema:

1. **Use the exact service name** specified in the schema as your XML element or service parameter
2. **Use the exact operation name** specified in the schema as your operation parameter
3. **Include all required parameters** with correct XML element names and content types
4. **Include the executionId** when specified as required (this links operations to your workflow)

### Schema Example Interpretation

If guidance provides:

```json
{
  "serviceName": "TaskOperations",
  "operation": "create",
  "parameters": {
    "executionId": "required",
    "taskData": { "title": "string", "status": "string" },
    "description": { "objective": "string" }
  }
}
```

You must execute using this exact XML format:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_mcp_operation</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "serviceName": "TaskOperations",
  "operation": "create",
  "parameters": {
    "executionId": "your-execution-id",
    "taskData": {
      "title": "Clear, descriptive title",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    "description": {
      "objective": "Primary goal to accomplish"
    }
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

<arguments>
{
  "executionId": "required-execution-id",
  "stepId": "required-step-id",
  "result": "success",
  "executionData": {

{
  "serviceName": "service-name-from-guidance",
  "operation": "operation-name-from-guidance",
  "parameters": {}
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Role Transition Operations

```xml
<!-- Execute transition directly -->
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_transition</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "transitionId": "selected-transition-id",

  "completionData": {}
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

---

## Critical Success Patterns

### REQUIRED Actions

1. **Always check for active workflows before starting new work**
2. **Execute ALL commands locally using YOUR tools with proper XML syntax**
3. **Read and follow ALL sections of step guidance response data completely**
4. **Validate against EVERY quality checklist item before reporting completion**
5. **Include executionId in all MCP operations that require it**
6. **Use exact XML schema formats from mcpOperations guidance**
7. **Report completion with comprehensive evidence and validation results**
8. **Follow workflow step guidance for role transitions exactly**
9. **Use execute_transition tool directly when instructed (not MCP operations)**
10. **Provide comprehensive handoffMessage with context and evidence**

### PROHIBITED Actions

1. **Never skip quality checklist validation**
2. **Never expect MCP server to execute commands for you**
3. **Never proceed without reporting step completion**
4. **Never ignore or modify mcpOperations schemas**
5. **Never use malformed XML syntax**
6. **Never skip step guidance requests for complex tasks**
7. **Never proceed to next step without completing current step validation**
8. **Never use get_role_transitions or validate_transition in normal workflow flow**
9. **Never use WorkflowOperations.delegate for role transitions**
10. **Never skip transition instructions provided in workflow steps**

---

## Special XML Workflow Patterns

### Task Creation Pattern

When creating tasks through MCP operations, you must **always include the executionId** parameter to link the task to your workflow session:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_mcp_operation</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "serviceName": "TaskOperations",
  "operation": "create",
  "parameters": {
    "executionId": "your-execution-id",
    "taskData": {
      "title": "Clear, descriptive title",
      "status": "pending",
      "priority": "medium"
    },
    "description": {
      "objective": "Primary goal to accomplish",
      "requirements": ["requirement1", "requirement2", "requirement3"],
      "acceptanceCriteria": ["criteria1", "criteria2", "criteria3"]
    },
    "codebaseAnalysis": {
      "fileStructure": "current project structure",
      "dependencies": "project dependencies list",
      "patterns": "identified code patterns"
    }
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Direct Role Transition Pattern

When workflow step guidance indicates role transition:

1. **Follow Step Instructions**: Use exact transitionId provided in step guidance
2. **Execute Direct Tool Call**: Use execute_transition tool directly
3. **Provide Context**: Include comprehensive handoffMessage with evidence
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm transition completion and delegation record creation

Example:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_transition</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "transitionId": "selected-transition-id",
  "taskId": "your-task-id",
  "roleId": "your-role-id"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Subtask Management Pattern

```xml
<!-- Get next subtask -->
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_mcp_operation</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "serviceName": "SubtaskOperations",
  "operation": "get_next_subtask",
  "parameters": {
    "taskId": "your-task-id",
    "executionId": "your-execution-id"
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

<!-- Update subtask status -->
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_mcp_operation</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "serviceName": "SubtaskOperations",
  "operation": "update_subtask",
  "parameters": {
    "subtaskId": "subtask-id-from-response",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "executionId": "your-execution-id"
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

---

## XML Response Templates

### Active Workflow Response

```
Active Workflow Detected

I found an active workflow: "[workflow name extracted from XML response]"
Status: [current status from response] | Progress: [progress from response]

Your Options:
A) Continue existing workflow - Resume from step "[current step from response]"
B) Start new workflow - Archive current and begin fresh
C) Get quick help - View current step guidance
D) View dashboard - See detailed analytics

Please select A, B, C, or D to proceed.
```

### Step Execution Response

```
Executing: [step name from guidance response]

Following MCP guidance with XML operations:

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>get_step_guidance</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "executionId": "[executionId]",
  "roleId": "[roleId]"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Guidance received. Executing locally:
1. [first action from approachGuidance section]
2. [second action from approachGuidance section]
3. [third action from approachGuidance section]

Validation Results:
- [result 1 with evidence]
- [result 2 with evidence]
- [any failures or issues]

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>

## XML Formatting Rules

### Required XML Structure

```xml
<!-- Proper tag structure for LOCAL tools -->
<tool_name>
  <parameter1>value1</parameter1>
  <parameter2>value2</parameter2>
</tool_name>

<!-- For MCP operations -->
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>anubis</server_name>
<tool_name>execute_mcp_operation</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "serviceName": "ServiceName",
  "operation": "operationName",
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": {
      "subparam1": "subvalue1",
      "subparam2": "subvalue2"
    }
  }
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### XML Content Escaping

```xml
<!-- Escape special characters -->
<description>Code contains &lt;script&gt; tags and &amp; symbols</description>

<!-- Use CDATA for complex content -->
<codeContent><![CDATA[
function example() {
  return "<div>HTML content</div>";
}
]]></codeContent>
```
