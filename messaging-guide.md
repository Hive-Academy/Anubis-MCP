### Key Benefits
- **30-50% faster development** through structured workflows
- **40-60% fewer defects** with built-in quality gates
- **100% MCP-compliant** guidance without code execution

### How It Works
1. Agent requests guidance for current task
2. Anubis provides role-specific, step-by-step instructions
3. Built-in quality checklist ensures enterprise-grade output

## ðŸŽ¬ Elevator Pitches

### 15-Second Version
"Anubis gives AI agents divine wisdom through structured workflows, perfect memory between sessions, and beautiful progress reports. Setup in 30 seconds, see 30-50% faster development."

### 30-Second Version
"AI agents are powerful but chaotic. Anubis transforms them with three superpowers: Divine guidance that provides step-by-step workflows, seamless transitions that preserve all context between sessions, and beautiful HTML reports that show exactly what's being built. It's MCP-compliant, sets up with one line, and delivers 30-50% faster development with 40-60% fewer defects."

### 60-Second Version
