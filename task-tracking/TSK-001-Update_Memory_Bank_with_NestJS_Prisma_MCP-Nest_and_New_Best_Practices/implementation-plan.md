## 1. Overview

This plan outlines the subtasks required to update the project's memory bank documentation and create new best practice rule files based on the provided research report. The primary goal is to accurately reflect NestJS, Prisma, and `@rekog/mcp-nest` technologies in our project documentation.

This is a documentation-focused task. The Senior Developer will be responsible for content creation and editing of Markdown files.

## 2. Technical Summary of Approach

The Senior Developer will systematically address each documentation file identified in the `task-description.md` (Section 4: Detailed Requirements and Section 7: File and Component References). For each file, the content will be derived from the `research-report.md` and aligned with the specific requirements for that document.

-   Existing memory bank files (`ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, `DeveloperGuide.md`) will be updated.
-   New rule files (`nestjs-best-practices.md`, `prisma-best-practices.md`, `mcp-nest-integration.md`) will be created in the `rules/` directory.

## 3. Subtasks for Senior Developer

Each subtask involves taking content and recommendations primarily from the `research-report.md` and structuring it into the target Markdown files as specified in the `task-description.md`.

**General Instructions for Senior Developer for each subtask**:
-   Refer extensively to both the `research-report.md` (for content) and `task-description.md` (for specific requirements and acceptance criteria for each document).
-   Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the information presented.
-   Use appropriate Markdown formatting for readability (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.).
-   For updated files, integrate new information seamlessly with existing relevant content, or replace outdated sections as appropriate.
-   Save all work to the specified file paths using absolute paths (e.g., `D:/projects/cursor-workflow/memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md`).
