## Key Findings

### NestJS

-   **Core Concepts**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications. Uses TypeScript. Built around modules, controllers, and services (providers). Strong emphasis on Dependency Injection (DI).
-   **Benefits**: Structured architecture (inspired by Angular), improved maintainability and scalability, robust CLI for project generation, excellent TypeScript support, modularity.
-   **Architectural Patterns**: Commonly used with patterns like Clean Architecture (separating concerns into layers like Entities, Use Cases, Adapters, Frameworks). Supports REST and GraphQL APIs.
-   **Key Components**:
    *   **Modules (`@Module()`)**: Organize application components. Encapsulate controllers, providers, and other modules. `AppModule` is the root module.
    *   **Controllers (`@Controller()`)**: Handle incoming requests, route them, and return responses. Define route paths and HTTP methods (`@Get()`, `@Post()`, etc.).
    *   **Services/Providers (`@Injectable()`)**: Encapsulate business logic, data access, etc. Can be injected into controllers or other services.
    *   **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Classes used to define the shape of data for requests and responses, often used with validation pipes (`class-validator`).

### Prisma

-   **Core Concepts**: A next-generation open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database access with a type-safe client and a declarative schema definition.
-   **Benefits**: Strong type-safety (reduces runtime errors), auto-generated and tailored query builder (`PrismaClient`), intuitive schema definition (`schema.prisma`), built-in migration system (`prisma migrate`), supports multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB).
-   **Key Components & Workflow**:
    *   **`schema.prisma`**: Defines database models, relations, and data source (connection URL).
    *   **Prisma CLI**: Used for initializing Prisma (`prisma init`), generating migrations (`prisma migrate dev`), and generating Prisma Client (`prisma generate`).
    *   **`PrismaClient`**: A type-safe query builder generated from the schema. Used to perform CRUD operations and other database queries.
    *   **Migrations**: SQL files generated by Prisma Migrate based on schema changes.
-   **Integration with NestJS**:
    *   Typically involves creating a `PrismaService` that extends `PrismaClient` and implements `OnModuleInit` to connect to the database.
    *   This `PrismaService` is then provided by a `PrismaModule` and can be injected into other NestJS services that need database access.

### `@rekog/mcp-nest`

-   **Core Concepts**: A NestJS module (`@rekog/mcp-nest`) designed to expose tools, resources, and prompts from a NestJS application using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
-   **Benefits**: Leverages NestJS's DI and familiar decorators for defining MCP components, supports various MCP transport types (HTTP+SSE, Streamable HTTP, STDIO), automatic discovery and registration of MCP elements, Zod-based validation for tool parameters, progress notifications, and Guard-based authentication.
-   **Key Components & Workflow**:
    *   **`McpModule.forRoot(options)`**: Imported into the main `AppModule` to initialize the MCP server capabilities. Options include `name`, `version`, `guards`, `transport`.
    *   **`@Tool()` decorator**: Applied to methods in an injectable NestJS service to define them as MCP tools. Requires `name`, `description`, and a Zod schema for `parameters`. Methods can access `request` context and report progress.
    *   **`@Resource()` decorator**: Similar to `@Tool()`, defines MCP resources.
    *   **Authentication**: Uses standard NestJS Guards, configured in `McpModule.forRoot()`.
    *   **Installation**: `npm install @rekog/mcp-nest @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod`.

## Technology/Pattern Analysis

### NestJS

-   **Overview**: A robust and opinionated framework that provides a solid structure for backend applications. Its modularity and use of TypeScript align well with building complex systems.
-   **Strengths**: Scalability, maintainability, strong typing, extensive documentation, active community, built-in DI system, CLI for code generation.
-   **Limitations**: Can have a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with Angular-like patterns or DI. The opinionated structure might feel restrictive for very small or simple projects.
-   **Implementation Complexity**: Medium. Setting up a basic application is straightforward with the CLI. Understanding modules, services, and controllers is key.
-   **Architectural Compatibility**: Highly compatible with microservices, monolithic applications, and various architectural patterns like Clean Architecture. It serves as a good foundation for the "Frameworks" layer in such an Earchitecture.
-   **Example Implementation**:
    ```typescript
    // user.module.ts
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { UserController } from './user.controller';
    import { UserService } from './user.service';

    @Module({
      controllers: [UserController],
      providers: [UserService],
    })
    export class UserModule {}
    ```

### Prisma

-   **Overview**: A modern ORM focused on developer experience and type safety. It shifts schema definition from code (like TypeORM entities) to a dedicated `schema.prisma` file.
-   **Strengths**: Excellent type safety (auto-completion, error prevention), intuitive schema definition, powerful migration tools, good performance, well-documented. Simplifies common API query patterns (filtering, pagination).
-   **Limitations**: Database support is extensive but not universal for all features across all DBs. Some complex queries might still require raw SQL (though Prisma offers escape hatches). Schema is typically monolithic in one file.
-   **Implementation Complexity**: Low to Medium. Initial setup is easy. Writing schema definitions is intuitive. Understanding `PrismaClient` API is straightforward for CRUD.
-   **Architectural Compatibility**: Works very well with NestJS. The `PrismaService` pattern provides a clean abstraction for data access.
-   **Example Implementation (within a NestJS Service)**:
    ```typescript
    // user.service.ts
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { PrismaService } from '../prisma/prisma.service'; // Assuming PrismaService exists
    import { User, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';

    @Injectable()
    export class UserService {
      constructor(private prisma: PrismaService) {}

      async createUser(data: Prisma.UserCreateInput): Promise<User> {
        return this.prisma.user.create({ data });
      }
    }
    ```

### `@rekog/mcp-nest`

-   **Overview**: A specialized NestJS module for creating MCP-compliant servers. It bridges the gap between NestJS's architecture and MCP requirements.
-   **Strengths**: Native NestJS integration using decorators and DI, supports multiple MCP transports, built-in validation with Zod, progress reporting, straightforward authentication integration.
-   **Limitations**: Specific to the MCP ecosystem. Relies on understanding both NestJS and MCP concepts. As with any specialized library, adoption depends on the MCP protocol's traction.
-   **Implementation Complexity**: Medium. Requires understanding NestJS concepts (modules, services, decorators, guards) and MCP concepts (tools, resources). The library itself simplifies the MCP boilerplate.
-   **Architectural Compatibility**: Designed specifically to make a NestJS application an MCP server. Fits naturally into the NestJS modular structure.
-   **Example Implementation (Tool definition)**:
    ```typescript
    // my.tool.ts
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { Tool, Context } from '@rekog/mcp-nest';
    import { z } from 'zod';

    @Injectable()
    export class MyToolService {
      @Tool({
        name: 'example-tool',
        description: 'An example tool',
        parameters: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
      })
      async runTool({ message }: { message: string }, context: Context) {
        await context.reportProgress({ progress: 50, total: 100 });
        return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Processed: ${message}` }] };
      }
    }
    ```

## Best Practices Identified

### NestJS

1.  **Modularity**: Organize code into feature modules. Each module should have its own controllers, services, and potentially DTOs and entities.
2.  **Dependency Injection**: Leverage NestJS's DI system extensively. Declare services as `@Injectable()` and inject them where needed.
3.  **DTOs and Validation**: Use DTOs with `class-validator` and `ValidationPipe` for robust request payload validation.
4.  **Configuration Management**: Use the `@nestjs/config` module for managing environment variables and application configuration.
5.  **Asynchronous Operations**: Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations, ensuring proper error handling.
6.  **Consistent Naming**: Follow consistent naming conventions for modules, controllers, services, files (e.g., `user.module.ts`, `user.controller.ts`, `user.service.ts`).
7.  **Clean Architecture**: Consider principles of Clean Architecture for larger applications to separate concerns effectively.

### Prisma

1.  **Dedicated `PrismaService`**: Create a `PrismaService` in NestJS that extends `PrismaClient` and handles the database connection. This service should be part of a `PrismaModule`.
2.  **Schema Definition**: Keep `schema.prisma` as the single source of truth for your database schema.
3.  **Migrations**: Always use `prisma migrate dev` for schema changes in development. Review generated migration files. For production, use `prisma migrate deploy`.
4.  **Type Safety**: Leverage Prisma Client's generated types in your services and DTOs to maintain end-to-end type safety.
5.  **Transaction Management**: Use Prisma's transaction API (`$transaction`) for operations that need to be atomic.
6.  **Error Handling**: Be aware of Prisma-specific errors and handle them appropriately (e.g., unique constraint violations).
7.  **Seeding**: Use Prisma's seeding capabilities (`prisma db seed`) for populating development/test databases.

### `@rekog/mcp-nest`

1.  **Clear Tool/Resource Definitions**: Provide comprehensive descriptions and well-defined Zod schemas for tool parameters.
2.  **Use NestJS Services**: Define MCP tools and resources within NestJS injectable services to leverage DI for accessing other parts of your application (e.g., PrismaService).
3.  **Authentication**: Implement robust authentication using NestJS Guards and apply them via `McpModule.forRoot()`.
4.  **Progress Reporting**: Utilize `context.reportProgress()` in long-running tools to provide feedback to the client.
5.  **Error Handling**: Ensure tools and resources handle errors gracefully and return appropriate MCP error responses if necessary.
6.  **Transport Configuration**: Choose and configure the appropriate MCP transport (HTTP+SSE, Streamable HTTP, STDIO) based on the use case.

## Implementation Approaches

### Integrating NestJS, Prisma, and `@rekog/mcp-nest`

1.  **Project Setup**:
    *   Initialize a new NestJS project: `nest new my-mcp-app`
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install @rekog/mcp-nest @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod prisma @prisma/client @nestjs/config class-validator class-transformer`
    *   Initialize Prisma: `npx prisma init`
2.  **Prisma Configuration**:
    *   Define models in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   Set up `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
    *   Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev --name initial-migration`
    *   Create `PrismaModule` and `PrismaService` as described in Prisma best practices.
3.  **MCP Module Configuration**:
    *   In `app.module.ts`, import `McpModule.forRoot({ name: 'my-mcp-app', version: '1.0.0', guards: [MyAuthGuard] /* if needed */ })`.
    *   Import `PrismaModule`.
4.  **Define MCP Tools/Resources**:
    *   Create a NestJS service (e.g., `MyToolsService`).
    *   Inject `PrismaService` into `MyToolsService` if database access is needed by tools.
    *   Decorate methods in `MyToolsService` with `@Tool` and `@Resource`. Define parameter schemas using Zod.
    *   Implement the logic for these tools/resources, using `PrismaService` for data operations.
5.  **Provide and Export**:
    *   Provide `MyToolsService` (and any auth guards) in `AppModule`.
    *   The `@rekog/mcp-nest` module will automatically discover and register these tools.
