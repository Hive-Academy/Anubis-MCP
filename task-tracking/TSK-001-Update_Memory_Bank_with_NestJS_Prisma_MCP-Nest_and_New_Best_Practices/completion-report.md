# Completion Report: TSK-001 - Update Memory Bank & Rules with NestJS, Prisma, and MCP-Nest

**Task ID**: TSK-001
**Task Name**: Update Memory Bank with NestJS, Prisma, MCP-Nest, and New Best Practices
**Completion Date**: July 28, 2024
**Completed By**: Boomerang (Final Verification)

## 1. Task Summary

This task aimed to modernize the project's memory bank and create new best practice rule files by incorporating research findings on NestJS, Prisma, and the `@rekog/mcp-nest` library. The deliverables included updates to `ProjectOverview.md`, `TechnicalArchitecture.md`, and `DeveloperGuide.md`, and the creation of new files: `rules/nestjs-best-practices.md`, `rules/prisma-best-practices.md`, and `rules/mcp-nest-integration.md`.

## 3. Quality Gate Summary

-   **Architect to Senior Developer**: Subtasks were clearly defined based on research.
-   **Senior Developer to Architect**: All documentation subtasks were completed with AC verification.
-   **Architect to Code Review**: All deliverables were consolidated and submitted for review.
-   **Code Review to Architect**: A thorough review was conducted, and the deliverables were **APPROVED**.
-   **Architect to Boomerang**: Verified implementation meeting all criteria was returned.
-   **Boomerang Final Verification**: All criteria confirmed as satisfied.

## 4. Delegation Effectiveness Evaluation

-   **Component Breakdown (Architect)**: The Architect effectively broke down the overall documentation update task into six manageable subtasks, one for each target file. This was appropriate for the nature of the work.
-   **Interface Definition (Architect to Senior Developer)**: The Architect provided clear instructions for each subtask, including references to the research report for content and the task description for specific ACs. This clarity facilitated focused work by the Senior Developer.
-   **Implementation Quality (Senior Developer)**: The Senior Developer successfully addressed all subtasks, creating/updating the Markdown files as required, deriving content from the research, and performing initial AC verification. The detailed completion report was helpful.
-   **Junior Role Utilization**: Not applicable for this task, as implementation was handled by the Senior Developer role.
-   **Knowledge Transfer**: The core purpose of this task was knowledge capture and dissemination through updated documentation. The workflow successfully translated research findings into permanent project assets (updated memory bank and new rule files).

Overall, the delegation and execution process was effective for this documentation-focused task.

## 5. Memory Bank Updates

The primary output of this task *is* the update to the memory bank files and the creation of new rule files. These files now contain the latest knowledge regarding NestJS, Prisma, and `@rekog/mcp-nest` integration.

-   `memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md` (updated)
-   `memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md` (updated)
-   `memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` (updated)
-   `rules/nestjs-best-practices.md` (new)
-   `rules/prisma-best-practices.md` (new)
-   `rules/mcp-nest-integration.md` (new)

These documents are considered the current source of truth for these topics within the project.

## 6. Final Outcome

The task is considered **COMPLETE**. The project's memory bank and rule set have been successfully updated to reflect modern best practices and technologies, aligning with the research conducted.
