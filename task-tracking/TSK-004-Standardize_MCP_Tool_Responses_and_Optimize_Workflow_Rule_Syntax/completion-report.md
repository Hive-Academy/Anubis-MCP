# Completion Report: TSK-004 - Standardize MCP Tool Responses and Optimize Workflow Rule Syntax

## 1. Summary
Task TSK-004 has been successfully completed. All Acceptance Criteria are met.

The two primary objectives were achieved:
1.  **MCP Tool Response Standardization**: Key MCP tools that retrieve context or data have been modified to return a standardized two-part text-based JSON response. This format clearly indicates "unchanged," "not found," or "empty" states, includes a descriptive `contextIdentifier`, and provides relevant metadata. The tools updated include `getTaskContext`, `getContextDiff`, `listTasks`, `searchTasksTool`, report retrieval tools, and `check_batch_status`.
2.  **Workflow Rule Token Optimization**: All core workflow rule documents (`000` through `500` series in `enhanced-workflow-rules/`) have been updated to use token-optimized MCP command syntax (e.g., `mcp:status`, `mcp:note`, `mcp:delegate`), shortcodes for roles, statuses, and documents, and the revised role transition format. Crucially, the `000-workflow-core.md` was updated to explicitly guide AI agents to prefer `mcp:get_context_diff` for efficient, delta-based context updates, enhancing token efficiency.

The Code Review Report (CRD) was "Approved with Reservations," with the single reservation regarding "unchanged" logic in `getTaskContext` being addressed by clarifying its scope and emphasizing the role of `getContextDiff` for handling unchanged context slices efficiently.

## 3. Key Implementation Points

*   **Batch B001 (MCP Tool Response Standardization)**:
    *   Successfully modified `task-query-operations.service.ts`, `report-operations.service.ts`, `implementation-plan-operations.service.ts`, and `task-crud-operations.service.ts`.
    *   Implemented the two-part text/JSON response for "not found" and "empty" states.
    *   `getContextDiff` correctly handles "unchanged" states for context slices.
*   **Batch B002 (Workflow Rule Token Optimization)**:
    *   Successfully updated all core rule files (`000-workflow-core.md` to `500-code-review-role.md`).
    *   Applied new MCP shorthand, shortcodes, and transition formats.
    *   Enhanced `000-workflow-core.md` to guide preference for `mcp:get_context_diff` for efficient updates.
*   **CRD Resolution**: The AWR from the CRD was resolved by clarifying the scope of "unchanged" detection for `getTaskContext` and emphasizing the role of `getContextDiff` and updating `000-workflow-core.md` accordingly.

## 4. Memory Bank Update Recommendations

*   **`memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md` (MB-DG)**:
    *   Add a new section or update an existing one on "MCP Tool Usage Best Practices."
    *   Explain the standardized two-part response format for "unchanged," "not found," or "empty" contexts, including the `contextIdentifier`.
    *   Strongly recommend the preferential use of `mcp:get_context_diff(taskId, lastContextHash, sliceType)` for fetching updates to known context slices to maximize token efficiency. Detail when `mcp:get_task_context(taskId, sliceType)` or `mcp:get_task_context(taskId)` would be more appropriate.
    *   Reference the updated "Context Management" section in `000-workflow-core.md`.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   Consider a future task to enhance `mcp:get_task_context` to optionally accept a client-provided hash of the entire task object. If the hash matches the server's current version, `getTaskContext` could then return a standardized "unchanged" response for the *entire object*, further optimizing cases where a full object refresh is requested but no change has occurred. This was out of scope for TSK-004 but aligns with the long-term goal of token efficiency.
