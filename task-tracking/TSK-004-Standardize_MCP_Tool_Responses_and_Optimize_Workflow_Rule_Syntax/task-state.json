  "description": "This task involves two primary objectives:\n1.  **MCP Tool Response Standardization**: Modify all existing MCP tools. When a tool determines that no changes have occurred or no new information is available for a given context (e.g., a context retrieval request where the data hasn't changed since the last access), it must return a specific structured message. The message should indicate that no changes were found and provide context details. The format to be returned is:\n    ```javascript\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: 'text',\n          text: `No changes to {contextIdentifier} context for task {taskId} since last retrieval.`,\n        },\n        {\n          type: 'text',\n          text: JSON.stringify({\n            unchanged: true,\n            contextHash: currentHash,\n            contextType: contextIdentifier,\n          })\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n    ```\n    This applies to all tools that retrieve or might return cached/unchanged data.\n\n2.  **Workflow Rule Token Optimization**: Review and update all workflow rule documents located in the `@enhanced-workflow-rules` directory. The updates should replace existing MCP tool call syntaxes with the new token-optimized versions. This includes:\n    *   Adopting shorthand notations for MCP commands (e.g., `mcp:create(...)`, `mcp:status(...)`, `mcp:note(...)`, `mcp:delegate(...)`).\n    *   Implementing guidelines from section 3 (\"Adapting workflow rules for token optimization\") of the `@WORKFLOW_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` document.\n    *   Referencing the specific changes outlined in `@rules-updates-for-using-token-optimized-mcp.md` to ensure all new syntaxes are correctly applied.\n    The goal is to significantly reduce token usage in workflow operations by consistently applying these optimized command formats across all rule files.\n"
