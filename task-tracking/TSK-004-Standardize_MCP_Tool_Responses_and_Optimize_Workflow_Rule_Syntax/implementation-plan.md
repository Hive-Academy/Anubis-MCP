# Implementation Plan: Standardize MCP Tool Responses and Optimize Workflow Rule Syntax (TSK-004)

## 1. Approach

The implementation will be executed in two distinct batches. The first batch will focus on modifying the MCP server code to standardize tool responses for unchanged/empty contexts. The second batch will involve updating all workflow rule documents to adopt the new token-optimized syntax and guidelines.

## 2. Technical Decisions

- **Decision 1 (Tool Response Standardization)**: The specified JavaScript-like return structure (`content: [{type: 'text', ...}, {type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify({...})}]`) will be the target output format that the MCP client (Cursor) should receive. The MCP server tools will be modified to produce this structure, potentially by returning an object that the framework then marshals into this exact multi-part text response. The `contextIdentifier` will be a descriptive kebab-case string (e.g., `task-status`, `ip-batch-b001`, `research-report-data`).
- **Decision 2 (Workflow Rule Updates)**: All rule updates will strictly follow the shorthand notations and guidelines provided in `@WORKFLOW_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` and `@rules-updates-for-using-token-optimized-mcp.md`. A systematic review of each rule file will be conducted to ensure comprehensive adoption of the new standards.
- **Decision 3 (Tool Identification)**: A thorough search of the codebase under `src/task-workflow/mcp-operations/` and `src/task-workflow/services/` will be performed to identify all tools that retrieve data or context and thus require modification for standardized responses.

## 3. Batch Plan

### Batch B001: MCP Tool Response Standardization

**Focus**: Modify existing MCP tools to return a standardized response format when context is unchanged or no data is found.
**AC Coverage**: AC1, AC2, AC3

- **ST-001: Identify Target MCP Tools**
  - Description: Systematically review all services and operation files within `src/task-workflow/mcp-operations/` and `src/task-workflow/services/` (e.g., `TaskCrudOperationsService`, `ImplementationPlanOperationsService`, `ReportOperationsService`, `ContextManagementService`, `TaskWorkflowService`, etc.) to list all tools that retrieve or return context data.
  - Deliverable: A list of identified tools and their file paths.
- **ST-002: Implement Standardized Response for `get_task_context` (and similar context retrieval tools)**
  - Description: Modify `TaskWorkflowService.get_task_context` (or its equivalent if refactored) and any similar core context retrieval tools. If the context for a task has not changed (e.g., based on a hash comparison if available, or if the underlying data is identical to a cached version), return the standardized "unchanged" response format.
  - `contextIdentifier`: e.g., `task-context`, `task-description`, `task-status`.
- **ST-003: Implement Standardized Response for `get_context_diff`**
  - Description: Modify `ContextManagementService.get_context_diff` (or its equivalent). If no differences are found or if the requested `sliceType` yields no data/is empty, return the standardized response format indicating no change or empty data.
  - `contextIdentifier`: e.g., `context-diff-task-description`, `ip-batch-b001`.
- **ST-004: Implement Standardized Response for Report Retrieval Tools**
  - Description: Modify report retrieval tools (e.g., `get_research_report`, `get_code_review_report`, `get_completion_report` in `ReportOperationsService`). If a report for a given task ID does not exist, return the standardized response format indicating data not found.
  - `contextIdentifier`: e.g., `research-report`, `code-review-report`.
- **ST-005: Implement Standardized Response for Implementation Plan/Subtask Tools**
  - Description: Modify tools like `get_implementation_plan`, `check_batch_status`, or any tools in `ImplementationPlanOperationsService` that retrieve plan/subtask data. If the requested data is empty or unchanged (e.g., an empty batch), return the standardized response.
  - `contextIdentifier`: e.g., `implementation-plan`, `batch-status-b001`.
- **ST-006: Implement Standardized Response for Other Identified Data Retrieval Tools**
  - Description: For any other tools identified in ST-001 that retrieve data (e.g., `search_tasks` if it can return empty result sets, `list_tasks` if no tasks meet criteria), implement the standardized response for empty/unchanged scenarios.
  - `contextIdentifier`: Specific to the tool, e.g., `search-results`.
- **ST-007: Unit/Integration Testing for Standardized Responses**
  - Description: Write or update unit/integration tests for each modified tool to verify: a) correct standardized response for unchanged/empty data, and b) continued correct functionality for changed/available data.

### Batch B002: Workflow Rule Token Optimization

**Focus**: Update all workflow rule documents to use the new token-optimized MCP command syntax and operational guidelines.

- **ST-013: Optimize `500-code-review-role.md`** - `Status: COM` - Changed mcp:context to mcp:get_task_context.
- **ST-014: Optimize other rule files** - `Status: COM` - Confirmed no other rule files exist in the target directory.

## 5. Code Review Feedback and Resolution

- **CRD Verdict**: Approved with Reservations (AWR)
- **Issue #1 (CRD)**: Confirmation of "Unchanged" Logic in `getTaskContext` (`task-query-operations.service.ts`).
  - **Resolution (üèõÔ∏èAR Clarified)**: The user's emphasis on token optimization and returning only necessary/changed data is critical.
    - `getTaskContext`'s primary role is to provide a full, current snapshot of the task. Implementing client-comparative "unchanged" detection (e.g., via client-sent hash of the entire task object) for `getTaskContext` itself introduces complexity beyond TSK-004's primary focus on response _format_ standardization and rule _syntax_ optimization. It will use the standardized "not found" response as implemented.
    - The core strategy for token-efficient context updates and handling "unchanged" scenarios relies heavily on `getContextDiff`. This tool _is_ designed to allow clients to fetch only specific slices or deltas, and it correctly implements the "unchanged" response based on comparisons of these slices.
    - Therefore, while `getTaskContext` itself won't perform complex client-state diffing for the entire object in this iteration, the overall workflow achieves AC1's spirit by strongly encouraging the use of `getContextDiff` for efficient, delta-based context retrieval. This clarification resolves the CRD reservation.
