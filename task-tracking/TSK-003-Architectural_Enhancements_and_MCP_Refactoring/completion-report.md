# Completion Report: TSK-003 - Architectural Enhancements and MCP Refactoring

## Summary
Task TSK-003, focused on major architectural enhancements and MCP tool refactoring, has been successfully completed. The primary goals of migrating tools from the old `task-workflow.service.ts` facade to new domain-specific MCP operation services, adopting a DDD-inspired file structure, and applying best practices have been achieved. The codebase is now more modular, maintainable, and adheres better to SRP. All build issues encountered during the extensive refactoring were resolved. The Code Review Report (CRD) has approved the implementation.

| AC-1  | MCP tools migrated                              | SATISFIED             | All listed tools are in new domain-specific services.                                                                                                   |
| AC-2  | Facade updated/removed                          | SATISFIED             | Old `task-workflow.service.ts` facade removed.                                                                                                          |
| AC-3  | New services integrated                         | SATISFIED             | New services are in `src/task-workflow/domains/` and integrated into `task-workflow.module.ts`.                                                         |
| AC-4  | Compilation & Tests                             | PARTIALLY SATISFIED   | Application compiles successfully. Automated tests were skipped by user request. Conceptual review of logic indicates correctness.                      |
| AC-5  | Best practices applied                          | SATISFIED             | Code generally applies SRP, DRY, explicit typing, async/await, NestJS/MCP-Nest conventions. Imports corrected.                                        |
| AC-6  | Improved organization & SRP                     | SATISFIED             | New DDD structure significantly improves organization and SRP.                                                                                          |
| AC-7  | Rationalized `task-crud-operations.service.ts`  | SATISFIED             | Tools like `update_task_description` and `search_tasks` are correctly located.                                                                        |
| AC-8  | DDD File Structure                              | SATISFIED             | New domain-based file structure implemented; old directories removed.                                                                                   |

## Key Implementation Points
-   **DDD Structure**: Successfully transitioned to a domain-driven structure under `src/task-workflow/domains/`, grouping files by features (crud, query, state, interaction, plan, reporting).
-   **MCP Operations Services**: Created new, focused MCP operation services for different domains (e.g., `TaskQueryOperationsService`, `TaskStateOperationsService`, `TaskInteractionOperationsService`, `ImplementationPlanOperationsService`, `ReportOperationsService`).
-   **Facade Removal**: The monolithic `task-workflow.service.ts` facade was entirely removed, and its responsibilities were distributed to the new specialized services.
-   **Build Stability**: Overcame significant build issues arising from widespread import path changes due to file restructuring.
-   **Modularity and SRP**: The changes significantly improve the modularity of the `task-workflow` feature and better adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle for services.

## Future Considerations
-   **Refine Typing**: As noted in the CRD, some `any` types persist. These could be addressed in future iterations to enhance type safety further.
-   **Testing**: Consider adding comprehensive tests for the new domain services to ensure robustness, especially since existing tests were skipped for this refactoring task.
-   **Memory Bank Update**: The `TechnicalArchitecture.md` (MB-TA) and `DeveloperGuide.md` (MB-DG) in the memory bank should be updated to reflect the new DDD structure and the locations/responsibilities of the MCP operation services.
