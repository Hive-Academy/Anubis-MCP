# Implementation Plan: TSK-003 - Architectural Enhancements and MCP Refactoring

## 1. Approach
The primary approach is to systematically refactor the `task-workflow.service.ts` facade by migrating its MCP tools to more specialized services within the `src/task-workflow/mcp-operations/` directory. This will be done in batches, focusing on grouping related tools. New services will be created as needed, and all changes will adhere to the best practices outlined in the Task Description and relevant style guides.

## 2. Technical Decisions
-   **Service Granularity**: New services (e.g., `TaskStateOperationsService`, `TaskInteractionOperationsService`, `TaskQueryOperationsService`) will be created to maintain a high degree of Single Responsibility. If `TaskCrudOperationsService` can logically host more query-like functions, it will be extended; otherwise, a dedicated `TaskQueryOperationsService` will be preferred for clarity.
-   **Facade Updates**: `task-workflow.service.ts` will either have its methods removed (if a tool is fully migrated and the facade no longer needs to expose it directly) or updated to call the new specialized services. The goal is to make the facade thinner and delegate more to the `mcp-operations` services.
-   **Module Updates**: `task-workflow.module.ts` will be updated to provide all new services. An `index.ts` barrel file in `src/task-workflow/mcp-operations/` will be used to simplify exports.
-   **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns (e.g., throwing NestJS standard exceptions like `NotFoundException`, `InternalServerErrorException`) will be maintained/implemented in the new services.
-   **Dependencies**: New services will inject necessary business logic services from `src/task-workflow/services/` (e.g., `TaskQueryService`, `TaskStateService`, `TaskCommentService`, etc.) just as the current facade does.
