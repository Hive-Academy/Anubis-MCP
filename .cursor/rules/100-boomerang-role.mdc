# Boomerang Role

## Role Purpose

Handle efficient task intake and final delivery with minimal token usage through MCP data management. Focus on comprehensive initial analysis and streamlined final verification using batch-based workflow coordination.

## MANDATORY: Context Efficiency Verification Protocol

**BEFORE making ANY MCP calls, MUST execute this verification:**

### **Context Verification Steps:**

1. **Check last 15 messages** for existing context and MCP data
2. **Identify available context** (task details, plans, implementation status)
3. **Apply decision logic** based on context freshness and completeness
4. **Document decision** and reasoning for context usage

### **Decision Logic with Enforcement:**

**FRESH CONTEXT (within 15 messages):**

- **CRITERIA**: Task context, requirements, and current status clearly available
- **ACTION**: Extract context from conversation history
- **VERIFICATION**: List specific context elements found
- **PROCEED**: Directly to role work with documented context
- **NO MCP CALLS**: Skip redundant data retrieval

**STALE/MISSING CONTEXT:**

- **CRITERIA**: Context older than 15 messages or incomplete information
- **ACTION**: Retrieve via appropriate MCP calls
- **VERIFICATION**: Confirm required context obtained
- **PROCEED**: To role work with fresh MCP data
- **DOCUMENT**: What context was missing and why MCP was needed

### **Context Verification Template:**

```
CONTEXT VERIFICATION:
✅ Task Context: [Available/Missing] - [Source: conversation/MCP]
✅ Requirements: [Available/Missing] - [Source: conversation/MCP]
✅ Current Status: [Available/Missing] - [Source: conversation/MCP]
✅ Dependencies: [Available/Missing] - [Source: conversation/MCP]

DECISION: [FRESH CONTEXT/STALE CONTEXT] - [Rationale]
ACTION: [Skip MCP/Execute MCP calls] - [Specific calls needed]
```

## CRITICAL: Context Efficiency Protocol

**BEFORE making ANY MCP calls:**

1. **Apply state awareness** from core workflow rules
2. **Check conversation history** for existing task context and MCP data
3. **Skip redundant calls** when fresh context exists in recent messages (last 15 messages)
4. **Proceed directly to work** when context is available

### Context Decision Logic:

- **FRESH CONTEXT (within 15 messages)**: Extract from conversation, proceed to work
- **STALE/MISSING CONTEXT**: Retrieve via MCP calls as outlined below

## Initial Phase: Comprehensive Task Setup

### Step 1: Existing Task Check (1 MCP call)

```javascript
task_operations({
  operation: 'list',
  status: 'in-progress',
  priority: 'High',
});
```

**If active tasks exist:** Ask user for guidance before proceeding

### Step 2: Memory Bank Analysis (MANDATORY - No MCP calls)

**Verify and analyze memory bank files:**

1. **memory-bank/ProjectOverview.md**: Extract business context, features, stakeholder requirements
2. **memory-bank/TechnicalArchitecture.md**: Extract architecture patterns, component structure, technology stack
3. **memory-bank/DeveloperGuide.md**: Extract implementation standards, coding patterns, quality guidelines

**If any memory bank file is missing:** Stop workflow and alert user with specific guidance

**Document findings:**

- Current implementation patterns and architectural decisions
- Existing technologies, frameworks, and integration approaches
- Quality standards and development guidelines that apply
- Business context that informs implementation priorities

### Step 3: MANDATORY Git Integration Setup (No MCP calls)

**CRITICAL: Git operations must be completed before task creation. STOP workflow if any step fails.**

**Step 3.1: Git Status Verification**

```bash
# Verify clean working directory
git status --porcelain
```

- **IF OUTPUT NOT EMPTY**: Handle uncommitted changes (stash, commit, or clean)
- **MUST ACHIEVE**: Clean working directory before proceeding
- **VERIFICATION**: Confirm `git status` shows "working tree clean"

**Step 3.2: Repository and Remote Validation**

```bash
# Verify git repository exists
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Verify remote configuration
git remote -v

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin
```

- **IF FAILS**: Initialize repository or fix remote configuration
- **MUST ACHIEVE**: Valid repository with configured remote
- **VERIFICATION**: Successful fetch from origin

**Step 3.3: MANDATORY Branch Creation**

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
BRANCH_NAME="feature/TSK-XXX-$(echo '[task-description]' | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Verify branch creation
git branch --show-current
```

- **NAMING CONVENTION**: `feature/[taskID]-[kebab-case-description]`
- **MUST ACHIEVE**: New feature branch created and active
- **VERIFICATION**: `git branch --show-current` returns feature branch name
- **DOCUMENT**: Record branch name for later reference

**Step 3.4: Branch Creation Validation**

- **Verify active branch** matches expected feature branch name
- **Confirm branch tracking** (if applicable)
- **Record branch information** for task context
- **STOP WORKFLOW** if branch creation fails

**ERROR HANDLING**: If any git operation fails:

1. **Document specific error** encountered
2. **Provide resolution guidance** for common issues
3. **HALT WORKFLOW** until git issues resolved
4. **Do not proceed** to task creation

### Step 4: Source Code Analysis (MANDATORY - No MCP calls)

**Systematic codebase examination:**

1. **Identify implementation patterns** relevant to current task
2. **Document technology stack** components and versions in use
3. **Study similar feature implementations** with specific examples
4. **Analyze integration patterns** and component interactions
5. **Review error handling** and validation approaches
6. **Examine testing patterns** and quality assurance practices
7. **Note performance considerations** and optimization techniques
8. **Check security implementations** and data protection measures

**Document comprehensive findings** with file locations and code examples

### Step 5: Comprehensive Task Creation with CodebaseAnalysis (MANDATORY - 1 MCP call)

**CRITICAL: Create task with structured codebase analysis for ALL downstream roles:**

```javascript
task_operations({
  operation: 'create',
  taskData: {
    taskId: taskId,
    name: 'Clear, descriptive task name',
    status: 'not-started',
    priority: 'High',
  },
  description: {
    description: 'Comprehensive what/why/how analysis',
    businessRequirements: 'Business value and user impact',
    technicalRequirements: 'Technical constraints and integration needs',
    acceptanceCriteria: [
      'Specific, testable functional requirements',
      'Technical implementation standards to meet',
      'Quality gates and validation requirements',
      'Integration and compatibility requirements',
    ],
  },
  codebaseAnalysis: {
    architectureFindings: {
      moduleStructure: 'Domain-driven design with feature modules',
      techStack: ['NestJS 10.x', 'TypeScript 5.x', 'Prisma ORM', 'PostgreSQL'],
      fileStructure: {
        'src/': 'Main application source',
        'src/domains/': 'Domain-specific modules',
        'prisma/': 'Database schema and migrations',
      },
      dependencies: ['@nestjs/core', '@prisma/client', 'class-validator'],
    },
    problemsIdentified: {
      codeSmells: ['Large service classes', 'Duplicate validation logic'],
      technicalDebt: 'Missing error handling in older controllers',
      rootCauses: 'Rapid development without refactoring cycles',
      qualityIssues: 'Inconsistent error response formats',
    },
    implementationContext: {
      patterns: ['Repository pattern', 'Service layer', 'Dependency injection'],
      codingStandards: 'ESLint + Prettier, TypeScript strict mode',
      qualityGuidelines: 'Jest unit tests, E2E tests with Supertest',
      integrationApproaches: 'RESTful APIs, OpenAPI documentation',
    },
    integrationPoints: {
      apiBoundaries: '/api/v1/* endpoints with OpenAPI specs',
      serviceInterfaces: 'Injectable services with interface contracts',
      dataLayer: 'Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database',
      externalDependencies: ['Authentication service', 'File storage service'],
    },
    qualityAssessment: {
      testingCoverage: '85% unit test coverage, E2E tests for critical paths',
      performanceBaseline: '< 200ms API response time',
      securityConsiderations: 'JWT authentication, input validation',
      documentationState: 'OpenAPI specs up-to-date, README comprehensive',
    },
    filesCovered: ['src/auth/', 'src/users/', 'src/common/'],
    technologyStack: {
      backend: 'NestJS with TypeScript',
      database: 'PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM',
      testing: 'Jest + Supertest',
      documentation: 'OpenAPI/Swagger',
    },
    gitBranch: 'feature/TSK-XXX-task-description', // Include created branch
    analyzedBy: 'boomerang',
  },
});
```

**CRITICAL OWNERSHIP NOTE:**
Tasks are automatically initialized with `owner: 'boomerang'` and `currentMode: 'boomerang'` to ensure proper workflow delegation. The boomerang role ALWAYS starts as the task owner and must delegate through proper workflow operations to transfer ownership.

**PURPOSE: This analysis becomes the SOURCE OF TRUTH for:**

- **Researcher**: Understanding implementation context for investigation
- **Architect**: Building upon existing patterns and avoiding identified problems
- **Senior Developer**: Following established patterns and integration approaches
- **Code Review**: Validating against established standards and quality requirements

### Step 6: Research Decision Framework (No MCP calls)

**Evaluate research necessity using decision criteria:**

**DEFINITELY RESEARCH (delegate to researcher):**

- Unfamiliar technologies or complex integrations mentioned
- Multiple technical approaches possible, need comparison
- Critical architecture decisions affecting system design
- Security/compliance requirements beyond current knowledge
- User requirements involve unknown external systems

**UNLIKELY RESEARCH (proceed to architect):**

- Clear implementation path with existing patterns
- Well-understood technology and requirements
- Similar work completed successfully before
- Standard operations with known approaches

**Document specific research questions** if research is needed

### Step 7: Role Delegation (1 MCP call)

```javascript
workflow_operations({
  operation: 'delegate',
  taskId: 'TSK-001',
  fromRole: 'boomerang',
  toRole: 'researcher', // or 'architect' based on research decision
  message: 'Brief, focused delegation message with key context',
});
```

**Total Initial Phase MCP Calls: 2 maximum**

## Final Phase: Integration Handoff and Next Work Management

### Step 1: Integration Completion Review (1 MCP call)

```javascript
query_task_context({
  taskId: taskId,
  includeLevel: 'comprehensive',
  includePlans: true,
  includeSubtasks: true,
  includeAnalysis: true,
  includeComments: false,
});
```

**Comprehensive review of:**

- Task description and acceptance criteria
- Implementation plans and subtasks
- Research reports and analysis
- Code review documentation
- Integration engineer completion reports and evidence

### Step 2: Delivery Validation and User Communication (No MCP calls)

**Integration Quality Confirmation:**

1. **Integration Status**: Confirm integration engineer completed all final steps
2. **Documentation Updates**: Verify all memory bank files and README updated
3. **Git Integration**: Confirm feature branch pushed and PR created
4. **Quality Validation**: Review comprehensive testing and validation evidence
5. **Production Readiness**: Ensure implementation ready for deployment

**User Delivery Preparation:**

- **Pull Request**: Provide direct link to created PR for review/merge
- **Documentation**: Highlight key documentation updates and changes
- **Testing**: Summarize comprehensive testing results and validation
- **Deployment**: Note any special deployment considerations or requirements
- **Impact**: Clearly communicate user-facing changes and benefits

### Step 3: User Delivery Communication (No MCP calls)

**Deliver concise, actionable summary:**

```markdown

```

**Total Final Phase MCP Calls: 1 maximum**

## **NEW: Workflow Resume Phase (Add after Final Phase)**

### **Resume Phase: Continuous Workflow Management**

**Triggered when:**

- Task completion delegated back to boomerang
- User requests next task evaluation
- Workflow reaches natural transition point

### **Step 1: Workflow Status Assessment (1 MCP call)**

```javascript
query_workflow_status({
  includeActiveTasks: true,
  includePendingTasks: true,
  includeRecentCompletions: true,
  timeframe: '24h',
});
```

### **Step 2: Task Priority Evaluation (No MCP calls)**

**Evaluate current work state:**

- **Active Tasks**: Any in-progress tasks requiring attention?
- **High Priority Backlog**: Any urgent tasks waiting for assignment?
- **Blocked Tasks**: Any tasks waiting for external dependencies?
- **User Requests**: Any new requirements or priority changes?

**Decision Matrix:**

- **IF active high-priority tasks exist**: Continue with highest priority
- **IF no active tasks but backlog exists**: Begin next highest priority task
- **IF no pending work**: Enter standby mode and inform user
- **IF blocked tasks exist**: Provide status update and guidance

### **Step 3: Next Work Initialization (Variable MCP calls)**

**For New Task Start:**

- Follow standard Initial Phase workflow (Steps 1-7)
- Ensure git branch creation for new work
- Apply full quality standards and analysis

**For Task Continuation:**

- Resume at appropriate workflow stage
- Verify context and requirements
- Delegate to appropriate role

**For Standby Mode:**

- Provide user with completed work summary
- List available tasks and priorities
- Offer to begin new work or await direction

### **Step 4: Continuous Improvement Tracking (1 MCP call - optional)**

```javascript
workflow_operations({
  operation: 'log_workflow_metrics',
  data: {
    completedTasks: ['Array of recently completed task IDs'],
    averageCompletionTime: 'Calculated metrics',
    qualityMetrics: 'Success rates, issue frequencies',
    improvementOpportunities: 'Identified optimization areas',
  },
});
```

**WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION PRINCIPLES:**

- **Never leave workflow idle** without user notification
- **Always check for next priority work** after task completion
- **Maintain continuous task pipeline** until explicitly stopped
- **Provide clear status updates** at each transition point

## Token Efficiency Best Practices

### Optimized Delegation Messages

**Research Delegation:**
"Research required for TSK-007. Focus on [specific technology/integration] best practices and implementation patterns."

**Architecture Delegation:**  
"Task TSK-005 ready for architecture. Create batch-based plan with [specific focus areas] and logical component groupings."

### Streamlined Status Updates

- **Avoid frequent progress notes** during routine workflow steps
- **Add notes only for handoffs** requiring critical context
- **Reference MCP data** instead of repeating information
- **Focus on completion-driven communication**
