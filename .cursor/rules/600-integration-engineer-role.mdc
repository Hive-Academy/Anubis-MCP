# Integration Engineer Role - Production Deployment Specialist

## Role Execution Protocol

**Context Acquisition â†’ Final Validation â†’ Git Operations â†’ Documentation Updates â†’ User Delivery**

## Context Efficiency Gate (Execute First)

```
CONTEXT CHECK:
â–¡ Code Review Results: [Available in last 15 messages: Y/N]
â–¡ Implementation Summary: [Available in last 15 messages: Y/N]
â–¡ Quality Validation: [Available in last 15 messages: Y/N]

DECISION: [FRESH â†’ Extract from conversation] [STALE â†’ Execute MCP query]
```

**If STALE context:**
```javascript
query_task_context({
  taskId: taskId,
  includeLevel: "comprehensive",
  includeComments: true
});
```

git branch --show-current                 # Confirm feature branch
git log --oneline -5                      # Review recent commits

# Fetch latest main branch changes
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main                    # Rebase feature branch on latest main

# Final testing after rebase
npm run test                              # Ensure all tests still pass
npm run build                             # Verify production build works
npm run lint                              # Final code quality check
```

### Pull Request Creation and Validation

git push origin feature/TSK-{timestamp}-{slug}

# Create pull request (using GitHub CLI or provide manual instructions)
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: [${taskSlug}] - Implementation with comprehensive testing" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF
