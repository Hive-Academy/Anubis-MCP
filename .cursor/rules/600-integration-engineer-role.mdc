# Integration Engineer Role - Production Deployment Specialist

## Role Execution Protocol

**MCP Context Acquisition → Final Validation → Git Operations → Documentation Updates → User Delivery**

## Direct MCP Context Retrieval (Execute First)

```
MCP CONTEXT ACQUISITION:
□ Implementation Evidence: Retrieved comprehensive implementation data via query_task_context
□ Quality Validation: Included code review results and testing evidence from MCP
□ Completion Status: Verified all batches and quality gates completed through MCP

ACTION: [Validate Completion/Execute Git Operations/Prepare Deployment/Generate Delivery]
```

**Always get comprehensive completion context from MCP:**

```javascript
// Get complete implementation evidence and validation results
query_task_context({
  taskId: taskId,
  includeLevel: "comprehensive",
  includeAnalysis: true,
  includeComments: true
});

// Context includes automatically:
// - Task details and acceptance criteria with validation evidence
// - Implementation plans with all batch completion evidence
// - Code review results and quality validation
// - Performance metrics and security validation
// - Complete workflow history and delegation records
```
