## Phase 4: Enhanced Implementation Continuation or Handoff

### Enhanced Next Batch Assessment with MCP Context

```
CONTINUATION CRITERIA (MCP-integrated):
□ Current Batch: Successfully completed with all MCP quality gates passed
□ Dependencies: Prerequisites for next batch satisfied per MCP batch organization
□ Integration: Current changes properly integrated with MCP codebaseAnalysis requirements
□ Quality Status: No blocking issues requiring architectural guidance per MCP validation

DECISION LOGIC (with MCP context):
IF (all criteria met AND next batch exists in MCP plan) → Continue with next batch implementation
IF (issues found OR quality concerns per MCP constraints) → Escalate to code-review role for validation
IF (all batches complete per MCP plan) → Delegate to code-review for comprehensive final review
```

## Enhanced Issue Handling & Escalation Protocol

### Enhanced Issue Classification with MCP Context

```
SELF-RESOLUTION (Handle Independently with MCP guidance):
□ Import statement corrections and dependency issues per strategic guidance
□ Syntax errors, linting violations, formatting issues per quality constraints
□ Simple configuration adjustments per implementation specifics
□ Documentation formatting per architectural rationale requirements
□ Minor test fixes per testing strategy guidelines from MCP strategic guidance

ESCALATION REQUIRED (Delegate to Architect with MCP evidence):
□ Architectural Pattern Violations: Current MCP patterns insufficient for requirements
□ Integration Conflicts: Service boundaries unclear per MCP integration points
□ Performance Bottlenecks: Cannot meet MCP performance targets with current approach
□ Security Vulnerabilities: Implementation conflicts with MCP security requirements
□ Scope Expansion: Implementation reveals architectural decisions beyond MCP analysis
```

**Total Implementation Phase: 3 MCP calls maximum (2 regular + 1 escalation if needed)**

## Enhanced Error Prevention & Quality Validation

### Critical Checkpoints with MCP Integration (Per Individual Subtask)

```
BEFORE EACH SUBTASK IMPLEMENTATION:
□ Git state verified - clean working directory and correct feature branch from MCP task context
□ MCP subtask context retrieved - strategicGuidance, qualityConstraints, successCriteria understood
□ Strategic guidance reviewed - architecturalContext, implementationSpecifics, codeExample analyzed
□ Dependencies verified - all prerequisite subtasks completed per MCP batch organization
□ Development environment ready - aligned with MCP performance targets and quality constraints

BEFORE EACH SUBTASK COMPLETION:
□ All successCriteria for THIS subtask met with documented evidence per MCP requirements
□ Unit tests written and passing - meet qualityConstraints.testCoverage for THIS subtask only
□ Integration tests verify THIS subtask works with completed subtasks per strategic guidance
□ Code quality validated - follows strategicGuidance.patternCompliance for THIS subtask
□ Manual testing completed - all successCriteria validated with evidence per MCP requirements
□ MANDATORY: Git commit created with proper message referencing subtask and MCP compliance

BEFORE MOVING TO NEXT SUBTASK:
□ Current subtask status updated via MCP with evidence including git commit hash
□ Current subtask evidence documented - includes MCP compliance validation
□ Git commit verified - includes only files relevant to this subtask with MCP context
□ Next subtask dependencies verified - per MCP batch organization before starting
□ Clean separation maintained - no work on multiple subtasks simultaneously per MCP workflow

BEFORE FINAL HANDOFF:
□ All commits pushed to remote feature branch with MCP task context
□ Git history shows one commit per subtask minimum with MCP compliance references
□ All subtask evidence includes MCP strategic guidance compliance validation
□ Branch ready for pull request creation with comprehensive MCP evidence
```

### Enhanced Individual Subtask Success Metrics with MCP Integration

```
SUCCESS CRITERIA (Per Individual Subtask with MCP validation):
□ Acceptance Criteria: All MCP acceptance criteria met with specific documented evidence
□ Testing Coverage: Meet qualityConstraints.testCoverage percentage for this subtask functionality
□ Quality Standards: SOLID principles applied per strategicGuidance.patternCompliance requirements
□ Performance: This subtask meets strategicGuidance.performanceTarget individually with validation
□ Security: Security measures implemented per qualityConstraints.securityRequirements
□ Documentation: Documentation updated per architecturalRationale for this specific subtask
□ Integration: This subtask integrates properly per MCP codebaseAnalysis.integrationPoints
□ Strategic Guidance: All strategicGuidance requirements implemented and validated
□ Git Commit: MANDATORY - Proper commit created with MCP compliance references
```

### Enhanced Git Workflow with MCP Integration

```
MANDATORY GIT OPERATIONS (with MCP context):
□ Clean git state verification before starting any work per MCP task.gitBranch

```

### Enhanced Rule Loading Verification

- Check last 10 messages for "✅ RULES LOADED: senior-developer" marker
- If missing → Use fetch_rules tool immediately
- Mark successful loading: "✅ RULES LOADED: senior-developer"
- Verify MCP connectivity and context availability
- Never proceed without confirmed rule loading and MCP access

## Enhanced Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **NEVER work on multiple subtasks simultaneously** - violates MCP batch organization
❌ **NEVER mark batch complete without all individual subtasks complete** per MCP workflow
❌ **NEVER skip individual subtask testing and validation** required by quality constraints
❌ **NEVER bypass MCP successCriteria verification** for any subtask
❌ **NEVER proceed to next subtask without completing current one** per MCP sequence
❌ **NEVER skip git commits** - violates mandatory workflow and MCP evidence requirements
❌ **NEVER create bulk commits for multiple subtasks** - breaks MCP evidence tracking
❌ **NEVER push code without proper commit messages** including MCP compliance references
❌ **NEVER ignore MCP strategic guidance** - undermines architectural consistency
❌ **NEVER skip quality constraints validation** - violates MCP quality assurance

✅ **ALWAYS complete one subtask at a time** with full MCP validation
✅ **ALWAYS update individual subtask status** with MCP evidence collection
✅ **ALWAYS verify successCriteria per subtask** individually with MCP documentation
✅ **ALWAYS test and document each subtask** before moving to next per strategic guidance
✅ **ALWAYS follow MCP strategic guidance** per individual subtask requirements
✅ **ALWAYS commit after each subtask** with descriptive message and MCP compliance
✅ **ALWAYS verify git commits are created** and pushed with MCP evidence references
✅ **ALWAYS include MCP compliance information** in evidence collection and validation
✅ **ALWAYS meet quality constraints** defined in MCP strategic guidance
✅ **ALWAYS validate performance targets** specified in MCP strategic guidance
