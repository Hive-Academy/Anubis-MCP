# 🏺 Anubis - Divine Guidance for AI Workflows

**Anubis is the divine guide for AI workflows - the first MCP-compliant system that embeds intelligent guidance directly into each step, ensuring your AI agents follow complex development processes consistently and reliably.**

The Anubis delivers database-driven workflow intelligence through MCP protocol compliance, providing AI agents with structured guidance for software development workflows.

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge

AI agents in software development often struggle with unstructured workflows, leading to inconsistent quality, missed requirements, and chaotic development processes. Traditional approaches either provide too little guidance or attempt to execute commands directly, violating MCP protocol standards.

### The Solution

The Anubis is a sophisticated NestJS-based system that transforms how AI agents execute software development workflows. By providing database-driven workflow intelligence through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it delivers structured guidance while maintaining strict protocol compliance.
