    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test with Cursor

1. **Restart Cursor** completely
2. **Reopen your project**
3. **Wait for MCP initialization** (check status bar)
4. **Test MCP functionality:**

```
Ask Cursor AI: "Can you check if the workflow-manager MCP server is connected and working?"
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if package is available
npm view @hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager

# Test CLI directly
npx @hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager --help
