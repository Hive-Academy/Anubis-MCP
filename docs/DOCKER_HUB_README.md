A comprehensive **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for AI workflow automation and task management in Cursor IDE and other MCP-compatible clients.

## üöÄ What is MCP Workflow Manager?

The MCP Workflow Manager provides a structured, role-based workflow system for AI development tasks. It enables seamless coordination between different AI modes (Boomerang, Researcher, Architect, Senior Developer, Code Review) with persistent task tracking, implementation planning, and progress monitoring.

### ‚≠ê Key Features

- **42+ MCP Tools** for comprehensive workflow management
- **Role-Based Workflow** with automatic task delegation
- **Persistent Task Tracking** with SQLite/PostgreSQL support
- **Implementation Planning** with batch-based subtask organization
- **Research & Code Review** integrated reporting
- **Real-time Status Updates** and progress monitoring
- **Multi-Transport Support** (STDIO, SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- **Production Ready** with NestJS + Prisma architecture
- **Automatic Database Setup** with migrations on container start

## üöÄ Quick Setup

**No manual installation required** - just add the configuration to your MCP client and everything works automatically!

### NPX Setup (Recommended - Automatic Project Isolation)

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

Add to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Setup (Production/Teams)

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí Project Isolation & Multi-Project Setup

### **IMPORTANT**: Avoiding Database Conflicts Between Projects

When using Docker across multiple projects, ensure each project has its own isolated database to prevent data conflicts:

#### ‚úÖ **Recommended: Project-Specific Volume Names**

```json
// For project "my-auth-app"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "my-auth-app-mcp-data:/app/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}

// For project "my-ecommerce-app"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "my-ecommerce-app-mcp-data:/app/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### ‚ùå **Avoid: Shared Volume Names**

```json
// DON'T DO THIS - All projects will share the same database!
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "mcp-workflow-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **NPX vs Docker: When to Use Which**

| Use Case                                | Recommended Approach                 | Reason                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Single Developer, Multiple Projects** | NPX with automatic isolation         | Simpler setup, automatic isolation |
| **Team Development**                    | Docker with project-specific volumes | Consistent environment across team |
| **Production Deployment**               | Docker with external database        | Scalability and reliability        |
| **Quick Testing/Prototyping**           | NPX                                  | Fastest setup                      |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**                     | Docker                               | Reproducible builds                |
