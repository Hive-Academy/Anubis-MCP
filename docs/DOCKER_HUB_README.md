A comprehensive **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for AI workflow automation and task management in Cursor IDE and other MCP-compatible clients.

## üöÄ What is MCP Workflow Manager?

The MCP Workflow Manager provides a structured, role-based workflow system for AI development tasks. It enables seamless coordination between different AI modes (Boomerang, Researcher, Architect, Senior Developer, Code Review) with persistent task tracking, implementation planning, and progress monitoring.

### ‚≠ê Key Features

- **10+ Domain-Based MCP Tools** for comprehensive workflow management
- **Role-Based Workflow** with automatic task delegation and strategic redelegation
- **Persistent Task Tracking** with SQLite database and automatic project isolation
- **Implementation Planning** with batch-based subtask organization
- **Advanced Reporting** with PDF, PNG, HTML, and JPEG report generation
- **Real-time Analytics** with delegation patterns and performance monitoring
- **Multi-Platform Support** (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) for Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Production Ready** with NestJS + Prisma architecture and Alpine Linux security
- **Zero Setup Required** - Docker handles all initialization automatically
- **Browser Integration** with Playwright and system Chromium for report generation

## üöÄ Quick Start

**No manual setup required!** Docker automatically creates directories, initializes the database, and handles all configuration.

### üåü **NEW: Streamlined Database Configuration**

**Unified Path Pattern**: Each project gets automatic database isolation with consistent paths:

```
project-a/data/workflow.db  ‚Üê Project A's database
project-b/data/workflow.db  ‚Üê Project B's database
project-c/data/workflow.db  ‚Üê Project C's database
```

### Simple Setup (Recommended)

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "workflow-manager-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ What happens automatically:**

- Database creation and initialization with schema migrations
- Directory structure setup with proper permissions
- Project isolation with unique databases per project
- Report generation capabilities with browser support

## üì¶ Alternative: NPX Package

**Prefer NPX over Docker?** The MCP Workflow Manager is also available as a self-contained NPX package with automatic dependency management.

### NPX Setup

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX with Environment Variables

For enhanced control over project paths and report generation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/mcp-workflow-manager"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project",
        "DISABLE_REPORT_GENERATION": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ NPX Benefits:**

- **üîß Automatic Dependency Management**: Prisma client generation and database migrations
- **üé≠ Conditional Playwright Setup**: Browser installation only when needed
- **üåç Environment Detection**: Adapts for different installation types
- **üõ°Ô∏è Graceful Degradation**: Disables optional features if dependencies unavailable
- **üöÄ Works on Clean Systems**: No local dependencies required beyond Node.js
- **üìä Automatic Project Isolation**: Each project gets its own database automatically

**Docker vs NPX:**

- **Docker**: Better for production, teams, and consistent environments
- **NPX**: Better for development, quick setup, and local workflows

## üîí Project Isolation & Multi-Project Setup

**Each project gets its own isolated database automatically!** No manual setup required.

### ‚úÖ **Recommended: Project-Specific Volume Names**

```json
// For project "my-auth-app"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "my-auth-app-mcp-data:/app/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}

// For project "my-ecommerce-app"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "-v", "my-ecommerce-app-mcp-data:/app/data", "--rm", "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Result**: Each project gets its own database automatically created and isolated.

### ‚ùå **Avoid: Shared Volume Names**

```json
// DON'T DO THIS - All projects will share the same database!
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "shared-mcp-data:/app/data",
        "--rm",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Local Report Access

**Want to access generated reports directly on your file system?** Use host directory mounting for local file access.

### Windows Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/data:/app/data",
        "-v",
        "D:/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### macOS/Linux Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflow-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--network=host",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/data:/app/data",
        "-v",
        "/Users/username/projects/my-project/workflow-reports:/app/reports",
        "hiveacademy/mcp-workflow-manager"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ What you get automatically:**

- **Database**: `my-project/data/workflow.db` (created on first run)
- **Reports**: `my-project/workflow-reports/` (created when reports are generated)
- **Project Isolation**: Each project gets its own database and reports
