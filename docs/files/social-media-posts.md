## Post 1: The Problem-Solution Hook 🎯

**Twitter/X Thread:**

```
🧵 Ever watched your AI agent write code like a caffeinated squirrel? 

Jumping between files, no clear plan, leaving half-finished functions everywhere?

You're not alone. Here's how we fixed it with ancient Egyptian wisdom... 𓂀

1/ The problem: AI agents are POWERFUL but CHAOTIC
- No structured approach
- Lost context between sessions  
- Zero visibility into progress
- Quality? What quality?

2/ Enter Anubis: Intelligent Guidance for AI Workflows 𓂀

Three superpowers that transform your agent:
🎯 Intelligent step-by-step guidance
🔄 Seamless context preservation  
🏆 Beautiful progress reports

3/ DIVINE GUIDANCE means your agent gets:
- Role-based expertise (Researcher → Architect → Developer → Reviewer)
- Quality gates at every step
- Structured workflows that actually make sense

Result? 30-50% faster development 🚀

4/ SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS mean:
- Never lose context when switching roles
- Full decision history preserved
- Pause Friday, resume Monday like nothing happened

Your agent remembers EVERYTHING. 100% context retention 🧠

5/ BEAUTIFUL REPORTS mean:
- Interactive Chart.js dashboards
- Mobile-responsive HTML reports
- Export-ready for stakeholders

Finally, VISIBILITY into what your AI is actually doing 📊

6/ Setup takes 30 seconds:

Add to your MCP config:
>> ```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anubis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hive-academy/anubis"]
    }
  }
}
>>```

Then tell your agent: "Initialize Anubis workflow rules"

7/ Real developers are seeing:
✅ 40-60% fewer defects
✅ 25-40% productivity boost
✅ 5x better project visibility

Your AI agent is powerful. Give it the wisdom of the ancients.

## Post 2: The Transformation Story 📈

**LinkedIn Post:**

```
From Chaos to Intelligent Order: How Anubis Transformed Our AI Development Workflow

Picture this: You ask your AI agent to build a user authentication system.

BEFORE Anubis:
- Random file creation
- No consistent approach  
- Lost context between sessions
- "Where's the documentation?"
- "Did we test this?"

AFTER Anubis:
- ✅ Structured guidance through 5 specialized roles
- ✅ Every decision tracked and preserved
- ✅ Beautiful HTML reports showing exactly what was built

The magic? Three core capabilities:

1️⃣ DIVINE GUIDANCE - Your AI receives step-by-step wisdom for every task
2️⃣ SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS - Switch roles without losing any context
3️⃣ BEAUTIFUL REPORTS - Stakeholder-ready dashboards with one command

Results speak for themselves:
• 30-50% faster development
• 40-60% fewer defects  
• 100% MCP protocol compliance

Setup in 30 seconds. Transform your AI workflow forever.

## Post 4: The Developer Pain Point 💡

**Reddit r/programming:**

```
Title: Tired of AI agents creating spaghetti code? We built something different.

Every AI coding assistant I've used has the same problem - they're powerful but chaotic. No structure, no memory between sessions, no way to track what's actually being built.

We created Anubis to solve this with 3 core features:

🎯 **Intelligent Guidance** - Structured workflows with 5 specialized roles (Researcher, Architect, Developer, etc). Each role has specific responsibilities and quality gates.

🔄 **Seamless Transitions** - Full context preservation between role switches. Pause on Friday, resume Monday with zero friction.

📊 **Beautiful Reports** - Auto-generated HTML dashboards with Chart.js visualizations showing progress, decisions, and code metrics.

It's MCP-compliant (no code execution, just guidance) and works with Cursor, Copilot, and other agents.

Setup is literally one line: `npx -y @hive-academy/anubis`

We're seeing 30-50% faster development and 40-60% fewer defects in production use.
